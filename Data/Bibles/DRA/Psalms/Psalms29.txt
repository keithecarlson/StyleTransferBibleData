1 A psalm of a canticle, at the dedication of David's house.
2 I will extol thee, O Lord, for thou hast upheld me: and hast not made my enemies to rejoice over me.
3 O Lord my God, I have cried to thee, and then hast healed me.
4 Thou hast brought forth, O Lord, my soul from hell: thou hast saved me from them that go down into the pit.
5 Sing to the Lord, O ye his saints: and give praise to the memory of his holiness.
6 For wrath is in his indignation; and life in his good will. In the evening weeping shall have place, and in the morning gladness.
7 And in my abundance I said: I shall never be moved.
8 O Lord, in thy favour, thou gavest strength to my beauty. Thou turnedst away thy face from me, and I became troubled.
9 To thee, O Lord, will I cry: and I will make supplication to my God.
10 What profit is there in my blood, whilst I go down to corruption? Shall dust confess to thee, or declare thy truth?
11 The Lord hath heard, and hath had mercy on me: the Lord became my helper.
