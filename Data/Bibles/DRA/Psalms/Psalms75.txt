1 Unto the end, in praises, a psalm for Asaph: a canticle to the Assyrians.
2 In Judea God is known: his name is great in Israel.
3 And his place is in peace: and his abode in Sion:
4 There hath he broken the powers of bows, the shield, the sword, and the battie.
5 Thou enlightenest wonderfully from the everlasting hills.
6 All the foolish of heart were troubled. They have slept their sleep; and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands.
7 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, they have all slumbered that mounted on horseback.
8 Thou art terrible, and who shall resist thee? from that time thy wrath.
9 Thou hast caused judgment to be heard from heaven: the earth trembled and was still,
10 When God arose in judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.
