1 Unto the end, a psalm of a canticle for David himself.
2 Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered: and let them that hate him flee from before his face.
3 As smoke vanisheth, so let them vanish away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
4 And let the just feast, and rejoice before God: and be delighted with gladness.
5 Sing ye to God, sing a psalm to his name, make a way for him who ascendeth upon the west: the Lord is his name. Rejoice ye before him: but the wicked shall be troubled at his presence,
6 Who is the father of orphans, and the judge of widows. God in his holy place:
7 God who maketh men of one manner to dwell in a house: Who bringeth out them that were bound in strength; in like manner them that provoke, that dwell in sepulchres.
