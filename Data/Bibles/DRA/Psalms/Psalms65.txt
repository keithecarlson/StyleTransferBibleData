1 Unto the end, a canticle of a psalm of the resurrection. Shout with joy to God, all the earth,
2 Sing ye a psalm to his name; give glory to his praise.
3 Say unto God, How terrible are thy works, O Lord! in the multitude of thy strength thy enemies shall lie to thee.
4 Let all the earth adore thee, and sing to thee: let it sing a psalm to thy name.
5 Come and see the works of God; who is terrible in his counsels over the sons of men.
6 Who turneth the sea into dry land, in the river they shall pass on foot: there shall we rejoice in him.
7 Who by his power ruleth for ever: his eyes behold the nations; let not them that provoke him he exalted in themselves.
8 O bless our God, ye Gentiles: and make the voice of his praise to be heard.
9 Who hath set my soul to live: and hath not suffered my feet to be moved:
10 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us by fire, as silver is tried.
11 Thou hast brought us into a net, thou hast laid afflictions on our back:
12 Thou hast set men over our heads. We have passed through fire and water, and thou hast brought us out into a refreshment.
13 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,
