1 A canticle of a psalm for Asaph.
2 O God, who shall be like to thee? hold not thy peace, neither be thou still, O God.
3 For lo, thy enemies have made a noise: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
4 They have taken a malicious counsel against thy people, and have consulted against thy saints.
5 They have said: Come and let us destroy them, so that they be not a nation: and let the name of Israel be remembered no more.
6 For they have contrived with one consent: they have made a covenant together against thee,
7 The tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ismahelites: Moab, and the Agarens,
8 Gebal, and Ammon and Amalec: the Philistines, with the inhabitants of Tyre.
