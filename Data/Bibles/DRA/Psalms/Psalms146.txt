1 Praise ye the Lord, because psalm is good: to our God be joyful and comely praise.
2 The Lord buildeth up Jerusalem: he will gather together the dispersed of Israel.
3 Who healeth the broken of heart, and bindeth up their bruises.
4 Who telleth the number of the stars: and calleth them all by their names.
5 Great is our Lord, and great is his power: and of his wisdom there is no number.
6 The Lord lifteth up the meek, and bringeth the wicked down even to the ground.
7 Sing ye to the Lord with praise: sing to our God upon the harp.
8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth. Who maketh grass to grow on the mountains, and herbs for the service of men.
9 Who giveth to beasts their food: and to the young ravens that call upon him.
10 He shall not delight in the strength of the horse: nor take pleasure in the legs of a man.
