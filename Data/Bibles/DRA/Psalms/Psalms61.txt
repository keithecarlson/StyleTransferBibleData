1 Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of David.
2 Shall not my soul be subject to God? for from him is my salvation.
3 For he is my God and my saviour: he is my protector, I shall be moved no more.
4 How long do you rush in upon a man? you all kill, as if you were thrusting down a leaning wall, and a tottering fence.
5 But they have thought to cast away my price; I ran in thirst: they blessed with their mouth, but cursed with their heart.
6 But be thou, O my soul, subject to God: for from him is my patience.
7 For he is my God and my saviour: he is my helper, I shall not be moved.
8 In God is my salvation and my glory: he is the God of my help, and my hope is in God.
