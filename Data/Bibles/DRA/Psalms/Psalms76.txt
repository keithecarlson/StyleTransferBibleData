1 Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of Asaph.
2 I cried to the Lord with my voice; to God with my voice, and he gave ear to me.
3 In the day of my trouble I sought God, with my hands lifted up to him in the night, and I was not deceived. My soul refused to be comforted:
4 I remembered God, and was delighted, and was exercised, and my spirit swooned away.
5 My eyes prevented the watches: I was troubled, and I spoke not.
6 I thought upon the days of old: and I had in my mind the eternal years.
7 And I meditated in the night with my own heart: and I was exercised and I swept my spirit.
8 Will God then cast off for ever? or will he never be more favourable again?
9 Or will he cut off his mercy for ever, from generation to generation?
10 Or will God forget to shew mercy? or will he in his anger shut up his mercies?
11 And I said, Now have I begun: this is the change of the right hand of the most High.
12 I remembered the works of the Lord: for I will be mindful of thy wonders from the beginning.
