1 To the end, a psalm of David. The canticle of Jeremias and Ezechiel to the people of the captivity, when they began to go out.
2 A Hymn, O God, becometh thee in Sion: and a vow shall be paid to thee in Jerusalem.
3 O hear my prayer: all flesh shall come to thee.
4 The words of the wicked have prevailed over us: and thou wilt pardon our transgressions.
5 Blessed is he whom thou hast chosen and taken to thee: he shall dwell in thy courts. We shall be filled with the good things of thy house; holy is thy temple,
6 Wonderful in justice. Hear us, O God our saviour, who art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and in the sea afar off.
7 Thou who preparest the mountains by thy strength, being girded with power:
8 Who troublest the depth of the sea, the noise of its waves. The Gentiles shall be troubled,
9 And they that dwell in the uttermost borders shall be afraid at thy signs: thou shalt make the outgoings of the morning and of the evening to be joyful.
10 Thou hast visited the earth, and hast plentifully watered it; thou hast many ways enriched it. The river of God is filled with water, thou hast prepared their food: for so is its preparation.
