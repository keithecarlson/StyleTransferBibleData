1 A psalm for David. Rejoice in the Lord, O ye just: praise becometh the upright.
2 Give praise to the Lord on the harp; sing to him with the psaltery, the instrument of ten strings.
3 Sing to him a new canticle, sing well unto him with a loud noise.
4 For the word of the Lord is right, and all his works are done with faithfulness.
5 He loveth mercy and judgment; the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord.
6 By the word of the Lord the heavens were established; and all the power of them by the spirit of his mouth:
7 Gathering together the waters of the sea, as in a vessel; laying up the depths in storehouses.
8 Let all the earth fear the Lord, and let all the inhabitants of the world be in awe of him.
9 For he spoke and they were made: he commanded and they were created.
10 The Lord bringeth to naught the counsels of nations; and he rejecteth the devices of people, and casteth away the counsels of princes.
11 But the counsel of the Lord standeth for ever: the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
