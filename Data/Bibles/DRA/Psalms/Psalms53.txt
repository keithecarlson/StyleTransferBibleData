1 Unto the end, In verses, understanding for David.
2 When the men of Ziph had come and said to Saul: Is not David hidden with us?
3 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me in thy strength.
4 O God, hear my prayer: give ear to the words of my mouth.
5 For strangers have risen up against me; and the mighty have sought after my soul: and they have not set God before their eyes.
6 For behold God is my helper: and the Lord is the protector of my soul.
