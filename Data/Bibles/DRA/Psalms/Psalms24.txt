1 Unto the end, a psalm for David. To thee, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul.
2 In thee, O my God, I put my trust; let me not be ashamed.
3 Neither let my enemies laugh at me: for none of them that wait on thee shall be confounded.
4 Let all them be confounded that act unjust things without cause. shew, O Lord, thy ways to me, and teach me thy paths.
5 Direct me in thy truth, and teach me; for thou art God my Saviour; and on thee have I waited all the day long.
6 Remember, O Lord, thy bowels of compassion; and thy mercies that are from the beginning of the world.
7 The sins of my youth and my ignorances do not remember. According to thy mercy remember thou me: for thy goodness' sake, O Lord.
8 The Lord is sweet and righteous: therefore he will give a law to sinners in the way.
9 He will guide the mild in judgment: he will teach the meek his ways.
10 All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth, to them that seek after his covenant and his testimonies.
