1 They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Sion: he shall not be moved for ever that dwelleth
2 In Jerusalem. Mountains are round about it: so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth now and for ever.
3 For the Lord will not leave the rod of sinners upon the lot of the just: that the just may not stretch forth their hands to iniquity.
4 Do good, O Lord, to those that are good, and to the upright of heart.
5 But such as turn aside into bonds, the Lord shall lead out with the workers of iniquity: peace upon Israel.
