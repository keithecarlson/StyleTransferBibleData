1 Unto the end, a psalm for the sons of Core.
2 Hear these things, all ye nations: give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world.
3 All you that are earthborn, and you sons of men: both rich and poor together.
4 My mouth shall speak wisdom: and the meditation of my heart understanding.
5 I will incline my ear to a parable; I will open my proposition on the psaltery.
6 Why shall I fear in the evil day? the iniquity of my heel shall encompass me.
7 They that trust in their own strength, and glory in the multitude of their riches,
8 No brother can redeem, nor shall man redeem: he shall not give to God his ransom,
9 Nor the price of the redemption of his soul: and shall labour for ever,
10 And shall still live unto the end.
11 He shall not see destruction, when he shall see the wise dying: the senseless and the fool shall perish together: And they shall leave their riches to strangers:
12 And their sepulchres shall be their houses for ever. Their dwelling places to all generations: they have called their lands by their names.
13 And man when he was in honour did not understand; he is compared to senseless beasts, and is become like to them.
14 This way of theirs is a stumblingblock to them: and afterwards they shall delight in their mouth.
