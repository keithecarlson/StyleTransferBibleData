1 A psalm of a canticle, for the sons of Core, on the second day of the week.
2 Great is the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.
3 With the joy of the whole earth is mount Sion founded, on the sides of the north, the city of the great king.
4 In her houses shall God be known, when he shall protect her.
5 For behold the kings of the earth assembled themselves: they gathered together.
6 So they saw, and they wondered, they were troubled, they were moved:
7 Trembling took hold of them. There were pains as of a woman in labour.
8 With a vehement wind thou shalt break in pieces the ships of Tharsis.
9 As we have heard, so have we seen, in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God hath founded it for ever.
