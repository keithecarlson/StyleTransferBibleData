1 Unto the end, for David the servant of the Lord, who spoke to the Lord the words of this canticle, in the day that the Lord delivered him from the hands of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. [2 Kings 22.]
2 I will love thee, O Lord, my strength:
3 The Lord is my firmament, my refuge, and my deliverer. My God is my helper, and in him will I put my trust. My protector and the horn of my salvation, and my support.
4 Praising I will call upon the Lord: and I shall be saved from my enemies.
5 The sorrows of death surrounded me: and the torrents of iniquity troubled me.
6 The sorrows of hell encompassed me: and the snares of death prevented me.
7 In my affliction I called upon the Lord, and I cried to my God: And he heard my voice from his holy temple: and my cry before him came into his ears.
8 The earth shook and trembled: the foundations of the mountains were troubled and were moved, because he was angry with them.
9 There went up a smoke in his wrath: and a fire flamed from his face: coals were kindled by it.
10 He bowed the heavens, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.
11 And he ascended upon the cherubim, and he flew; he flew upon the wings of the winds.
12 And he made darkness his covert, his pavilion round about him: dark waters in the clouds of the air.
13 At the brightness that was before him the clouds passed, hail and coals of fire.
14 And the Lord thundered from heaven, and the highest gave his voice: hail and coals of fire.
15 And he sent forth his arrows, and he scattered them: he multiplied lightnings, and troubled them.
