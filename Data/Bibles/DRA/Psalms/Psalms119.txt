1 In my trouble I cried to the Lord: and he heard me.
2 O Lord, deliver my soul from wicked lips, and a deceitful tongue.
3 What shall be given to thee, or what shall be added to thee, to a deceitful tongue?
4 The sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals that lay waste.
5 Woe is me, that my sojourning is prolonged! I have dwelt with the inhabitants of cedar:
6 My soul hath been long a sojourner.
7 With them that hated peace I was peaceable: when I spoke to them they fought against me without cause.
