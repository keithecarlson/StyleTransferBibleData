1 Unto the end, in verses, a psalm for David, for the octave.
2 O Lord, rebuke me not in thy indignation, nor chastise me in thy wrath.
3 Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak: heal me, O Lord, for my bones are troubled.
4 And my soul is troubled exceedingly: but thou, O Lord, how long?
5 Turn to me, O Lord, and deliver my soul: O save me for thy mercy's sake.
6 For there is no one in death, that is mindful of thee: and who shall confess to thee in hell?
7 I have laboured in my groanings, every night I will wash my bed: I will water my couch with my tears.
8 My eye is troubled through indignation: I have grown old amongst all my enemies.
9 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity: for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.
10 The Lord hath heard my supplication: the Lord hath received my prayer.
