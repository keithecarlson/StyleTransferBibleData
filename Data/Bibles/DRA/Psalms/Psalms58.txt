1 Unto the end, destroy not, for David for an inscription of It title, when Saul sent and watched his house to kill him.
2 Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; and defend me from them that rise up against me.
3 Deliver me from them that work iniquity, and save me from bloody men.
4 For behold they have caught my soul: the mighty have rushed in upon me:
5 Neither is it my iniquity, nor my sin, O Lord: without iniquity have I run, and directed my steps.
6 Rise up thou to meet me, and behold: even thou, O Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel. Attend to visit all the nations: have no mercy on all them that work iniquity.
7 They shall return at evening, and shall suffer hunger like dogs: and shall go round about the city.
8 Behold they shall speak with their mouth, and a sword is in their lips: for who, say they, hath heard us?
9 But thou, O Lord, shalt laugh at them: thou shalt bring all the nations to nothing.
10 I will keep my strength to thee: for thou art my protector:
11 My God, his mercy shall prevent me.
