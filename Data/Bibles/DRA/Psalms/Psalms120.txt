1 I have lifted up my eyes to the mountains, from whence help shall come to me.
2 My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
3 May he not suffer thy foot to be moved: neither let him slumber that keepeth thee.
4 Behold he shall neither slumber nor sleep, that keepeth Israel.
5 The Lord is thy keeper, the Lord is thy protection upon thy right hand.
6 The sun shall not burn thee by day: nor the moon by night.
7 The Lord keepeth thee from all evil: may the Lord keep thy soul.
