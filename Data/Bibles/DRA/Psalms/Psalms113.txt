1 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a barbarous people:
2 Judea made his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
3 The sea saw and fled: Jordan was turned back.
4 The mountains skipped like rams, and the hills like the lambs of the flock.
5 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou didst flee: and thou, O Jordan, that thou wast turned back?
6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams, and ye hills, like lambs of the flock?
7 At the presence of the Lord the earth was moved, at the presence of the God of Jacob:
8 Who turned the rock into pools of water, and the stony hill into fountains of waters.
9 Not to us, O Lord, not to us; but to thy name give glory.
