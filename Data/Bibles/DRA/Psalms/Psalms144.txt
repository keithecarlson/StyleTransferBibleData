1 I will extol thee, O God my king: and I will bless thy name for ever; yea, for ever and ever.
2 Every day I will bless thee: and I will praise thy name for ever; yea, for ever and ever.
3 Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised: and of his greatness there is no end.
4 Generation and generation shall praise thy works: and they shall declare thy power.
5 They shall speak of the magnificence of the glory of thy holiness: and shall tell thy wondrous works.
6 And they shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and shall declare thy greatness.
7 They shall publish the memory of the abundance of thy sweetness: and shall rejoice in thy justice.
8 The Lord is gracious and merciful: patient and plenteous in mercy.
9 The Lord is sweet to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.
10 Let all thy works, O lord, praise thee: and let thy saints bless thee.
11 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom: and shall tell of thy power:
12 To make thy might known to the sons of men: and the glory of the magnificence of thy kingdom.
13 Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages: and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations. The Lord is faithful in all his words: and holy in all his works.
14 The Lord lifteth up all that fall: and setteth up all that are cast down.
15 The eyes of all hope in thee, O Lord: and thou givest them meat in due season.
