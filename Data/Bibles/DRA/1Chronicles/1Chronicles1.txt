44 And Bale died, and Jobab the son of Zare of Bosra, reigned in his stead.
45 And when Jobab also was dead, Husam of the land of the Themanites reigned in his stead.
46 And Husam also died, and Adad the son of Badad reigned in his stead, and he defeated the Madianites in the land of Moab: and the name of his city was Avith.
47 And when Adad also was dead, Semla of Masreca reigned in his stead.

50 He also died, and Adad reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Phau, and his wife was called Meetabel the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezaab.
