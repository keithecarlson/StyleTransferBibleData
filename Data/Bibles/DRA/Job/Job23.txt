1 Then Job answered, and said:
2 Now also my words are in bitterness, and the hand of my scourge is more grievous than my mourning.
3 Who will grant me that I might know and find him, and come even to his throne?
4 I would set judgment before him, and would fill my mouth with complaints.
5 That I might know the words that he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me.
6 I would not that he should contend with me with much strength, nor overwhelm me with the weight of his greatness.
7 Let him propose equity against me, and let my judgment come to victory.
8 But if I go to the east, he appeareth not; if to the west, I shall not understand him.
9 If to the left hand, what shall I do? I shall not take hold on him: if I turn myself to the right hand, I shall not see him.
10 But he knoweth my way, and has tried me as gold that passeth through the fire:
11 My foot hath followed his steps, I have kept his way, and have not declined from it.
12 I have not departed from the commandments of his lips, and the words of his mouth I have hid in my bosom.
13 For he is alone, and no man can turn away his thought: and whatsoever is soul hath desired, that hath he done.
14 And when he shall have fulfilled his will in me, many other like things are also at hand with him.
15 And therefore I am troubled at his presence, and when I consider him I am made pensive with fear.
16 God hath softened my heart, and the Almighty hath troubled me.
17 For I have not perished because of the darkness that hangs over me, neither hath the mist covered my face.
