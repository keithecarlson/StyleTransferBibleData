2 He that walketh in the right way, and feareth God, Cis despised by him that goeth by an infamous way.

5 A faithful witness will not lie: but a deceitful witness uttereth a lie.
6 A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: the learning of the wise is easy.
7 Go against a foolish man, and he knoweth not the lips of prudence.

12 There is a way which seemeth just to a man: but the ends thereof lead to death.
13 Laughter shall be mingled with sorrow, and mourning taketh hold of the end of joy.
14 A fool shall be filled with his own ways, and the good man shall be above him.
15 The innocent believeth every word: the discreet man considereth his steps. No good shall come to the deceitful son: but the wise servant shall prosper in his dealings, and his way shall be made straight.
16 A wise man feareth and declineth from evil: the fool leapeth over and is confident.
17 The impatient man shall work folly: and the crafty man is hateful.
18 The childish shall possess folly, and the prudent, shall look for knowledge.
19 The evil shall fall down before the good: and the wicked before the gates of the just.
20 The poor man shall be hateful even to his own neighbour: but the friends of the rich are many.
21 He that despiseth his neighbour, sinneth: but he that sheweth mercy to the poor, shall be blessed. He that believeth in the Lord, loveth mercy.
22 They err that work evil: but mercy and truth prepare good things.
23 In much work there shall be abundance: but where there are many words, there is oftentimes want.

26 In the fear of the Lord is confidence of strength, and there shall be hope for his children.
27 The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to decline from the ruin of death.
28 In the multitude of people is the dignity of the king: and in the small number of people the dishonour of the prince.

30 Soundness of heart is the life of the flesh: but envy is the rottenness of the bones.
31 He that oppresseth the poor, upbraideth his Maker: but he that hath pity on the poor, honoureth him.
32 The wicked man shall be driven out in his wickedness: but the just hath hope in his death.
