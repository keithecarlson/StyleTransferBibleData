1 Let Samaria perish, because she hath stirred up her God to bitterness: let them perish by the sword, let their little ones be dashed, and let the women with child be ripped up.
2 Return, O Israel, to the Lord thy God: for thou hast fallen down by thy iniquity.
3 Take with you words, and return to the Lord, and say to him: Take away all iniquity, and receive the good: and we will render the calves of our lips.
4 Assyria shall not save us, we will not ride upon horses, neither will we say any more: The works of our hands are our gods, for thou wilt have mercy on the fatherless that is in thee.
5 I will heal their breaches, I will love them freely: for my wrath is turned away from them.
6 I will be as the dew, Israel shall spring as the lily, and his root shall shoot forth as that of Libanus.
7 His branches shall spread, and his glory shall be as the olive tree: and his smell as that of Libanus.
8 They shall be converted that sit under his shadow: they shall live upon wheat, and they shall blossom as a vine: his memorial shall be as the wine of Libanus.
9 Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I will hear him, and I will make him flourish like a green fir tree: from me is thy fruit found.
