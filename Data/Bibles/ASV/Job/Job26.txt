1 Then Job answered and said,
2 How hast thou helped him that is without power! How hast thou saved the arm that hath no strength!
3 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom, And plentifully declared sound knowledge!
4 To whom hast thou uttered words? And whose spirit came forth from thee?
5 They that are deceased tremble Beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof.
6 Sheol is naked before God, And Abaddon hath no covering.
7 He stretcheth out the north over empty space, And hangeth the earth upon nothing.
8 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; And the cloud is not rent under them.
9 He incloseth the face of his throne, And spreadeth his cloud upon it.
10 He hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters, Unto the confines of light and darkness.
11 The pillars of heaven tremble And are astonished at his rebuke.
12 He stirreth up the sea with his power, And by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab.
13 By his Spirit the heavens are garnished; His hand hath pierced the swift serpent.
14 Lo, these are but the outskirts of his ways: And how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?
