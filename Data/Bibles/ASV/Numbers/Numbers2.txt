4 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred. 
5 And those that encamp next unto him shall be the tribe of Issachar: and the prince of the children of Issachar shall be Nethanel the son of Zuar. 
6 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and four thousand and four hundred. 
7 And the tribe of Zebulun: and the prince of the children of Zebulun shall be Eliab the son of Helon. 
8 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred. 
9 All that were numbered of the camp of Judah were a hundred thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four hundred, according to their hosts. They shall set forth first.
10 On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben according to their hosts: and the prince of the children of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur.

15 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty and five thousand and six hundred and fifty. 
16 All that were numbered of the camp of Reuben were a hundred thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and fifty, according to their hosts. And they shall set forth second.

18 On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their hosts: and the prince of the children of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud. 
19 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty thousand and five hundred.

32 These are they that were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers' houses: all that were numbered of the camps according to their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty. 
33 But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses. 
34 Thus did the children of Israel; according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so they encamped by their standards, and so they set forward, every one by their families, according to their fathers' houses.
