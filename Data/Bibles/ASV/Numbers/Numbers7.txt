1 And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it, and all the furniture thereof, and the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them and sanctified them; 
2 that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers' houses, offered. These were the princes of the tribes, these are they that were over them that were numbered: 
3 and they brought their oblation before Jehovah, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they presented them before the tabernacle. 
4 And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, 
5 Take it of them, that they may be used in doing the service of the tent of meeting; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service. 
6 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites. 
7 Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service: 
8 and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 
9 But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service of the sanctuary belonged unto them; they bare it upon their shoulders. 
10 And the princes offered for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their oblation before the altar. 
11 And Jehovah said unto Moses, They shall offer their oblation, each prince on his day, for the dedication of the altar.
