1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service. 
2 And be not fashioned according to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.
3 For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but so to think as to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to each man a measure of faith. 
4 For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members have not the same office: 
5 so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another. 
6 And having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith; 
7 or ministry, let us give ourselves to our ministry; or he that teacheth, to his teaching; 
8 or he that exhorteth, to his exhorting: he that giveth, let him do it with liberality; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.
9 Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. 
10 In love of the brethren be tenderly affectioned one to another; in honor preferring one another; 
11 in diligence not slothful; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; 
12 rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing stedfastly in prayer; 
13 communicating to the necessities of the saints; given to hospitality. 
14 Bless them that persecute you; bless, and curse not. 
15 Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep. 
16 Be of the same mind one toward another. Set not your mind on high things, but condescend to things that are lowly. Be not wise in your own conceits. 
17 Render to no man evil for evil. Take thought for things honorable in the sight of all men. 
18 If it be possible, as much as in you lieth, be at peace with all men. 
19 Avenge not yourselves, beloved, but give place unto the wrath of God: for it is written, Vengeance belongeth unto me; I will recompense, saith the Lord. 
20 But if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him to drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head. 
21 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
