1 I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men; 
2 for kings and all that are in high place; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity. 
3 This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; 
4 who would have all men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth. 
5 For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men, himself man, Christ Jesus, 
6 who gave himself a ransom for all; the testimony to be borne in its own times; 
7 whereunto I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth, I lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
8 I desire therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputing. 
9 In like manner, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefastness and sobriety; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly raiment; 
10 but (which becometh women professing godliness) through good works. 
11 Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection. 
12 But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness. 
13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve; 
14 and Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression: 
15 but she shall be saved through her child-bearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.
