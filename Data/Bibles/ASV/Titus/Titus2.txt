1 But speak thou the things which befit the sound doctrine: 
2 that aged men be temperate, grave, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, in patience: 
3 that aged women likewise be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good; 
4 that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, 
5 to be sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed: 
6 the younger men likewise exhort to be sober-minded: 
7 in all things showing thyself an ensample of good works; in thy doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity, 
8 sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us. 
9 Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing to them in all things; not gainsaying; 
10 not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things. 
11 For the grace of God hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men, 
12 instructing us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world; 
13 looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; 
14 who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own possession, zealous of good works.
15 These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
