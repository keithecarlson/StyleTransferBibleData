1 It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one of you hath his father's wife. 
2 And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you. 
3 For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him that hath so wrought this thing, 
4 in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus, 
5 to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. 
6 Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? 
7 Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been sacrificed, even Christ: 
8 wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
9 I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators; 
10 not at all meaning with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world: 
11 but as it is, I wrote unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat. 
12 For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within? 
13 But them that are without God judgeth. Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.
