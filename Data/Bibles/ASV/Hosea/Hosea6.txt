1 Come, and let us return unto Jehovah; for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. 
2 After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him. 
3 And let us know, let us follow on to know Jehovah: his going forth is sure as the morning; and he will come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain that watereth the earth.

11 Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for thee, when I bring back the captivity of my people.
