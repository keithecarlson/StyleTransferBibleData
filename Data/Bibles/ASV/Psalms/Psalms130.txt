1 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Jehovah.
2 Lord, hear my voice: Let thine ears be attentive To the voice of my supplications.
3 If thou, Jehovah, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?
4 But there is forgiveness with thee, That thou mayest be feared.
5 I wait for Jehovah, my soul doth wait, And in his word do I hope.
6 My soul waiteth for the Lord More than watchmen wait for the morning; Yea, more than watchmen for the morning.
7 O Israel, hope in Jehovah; For with Jehovah there is lovingkindness, And with him is plenteous redemption.
8 And he will redeem Israel From all his iniquities.
