1 Rejoice in Jehovah, O ye righteous: Praise is comely for the upright.
2 Give thanks unto Jehovah with the harp: Sing praises unto him with the psaltery of ten strings.
3 Sing unto him a new song; Play skilfully with a loud noise.
4 For the word of Jehovah is right; And all his work is done in faithfulness.
5 He loveth righteousness and justice: The earth is full of the lovingkindness of Jehovah.
6 By the word of Jehovah were the heavens made, And all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap: He layeth up the deeps in store-houses.
8 Let all the earth fear Jehovah: Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
9 For he spake, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.
10 Jehovah bringeth the counsel of the nations to nought; He maketh the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.
11 The counsel of Jehovah standeth fast for ever, The thoughts of his heart to all generations.
12 Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, The people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.
13 Jehovah looketh from heaven; He beholdeth all the sons of men;
14 From the place of his habitation he looketh forth Upon all the inhabitants of the earth,
15 He that fashioneth the hearts of them all, That considereth all their works.
16 There is no king saved by the multitude of a host: A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.
17 A horse is a vain thing for safety; Neither doth he deliver any by his great power.
18 Behold, the eye of Jehovah is upon them that fear him, Upon them that hope in his lovingkindness;
19 To deliver their soul from death, And to keep them alive in famine.
20 Our soul hath waited for Jehovah: He is our help and our shield.
21 For our heart shall rejoice in him, Because we have trusted in his holy name.
22 Let thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, be upon us, According as we have hoped in thee.
