1 135 Praise ye Jehovah. Praise ye the name of Jehovah; Praise him, O ye servants of Jehovah,
2 Ye that stand in the house of Jehovah, In the courts of the house of our God.
3 Praise ye Jehovah; for Jehovah is good: Sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.
4 For Jehovah hath chosen Jacob unto himself, And Israel for his own possession.
5 For I know that Jehovah is great, And that our Lord is above all gods.
6 Whatsoever Jehovah pleased, that hath he done, In heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;
7 Who causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; Who maketh lightnings for the rain; Who bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries;
8 Who smote the first-born of Egypt, Both of man and beast;
9 Who sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, Upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants;
10 Who smote many nations, And slew mighty kings,
11 Sihon king of the Amorites, And Og king of Bashan, And all the kingdoms of Canaan,
12 And gave their land for a heritage, A heritage unto Israel his people.
13 Thy name, O Jehovah, endureth for ever; Thy memorial name, O Jehovah, throughout all generations.
14 For Jehovah will judge his people, And repent himself concerning his servants.
15 The idols of the nations are silver and gold, The work of men's hands.
16 They have mouths, but they speak not; Eyes have they, but they see not;
17 They have ears, but they hear not; Neither is there any breath in their mouths.
18 They that make them shall be like unto them; Yea, every one that trusteth in them.
19 O house of Israel, bless ye Jehovah: O house of Aaron, bless ye Jehovah:
20 O house of Levi, bless ye Jehovah: Ye that fear Jehovah, bless ye Jehovah.
21 Blessed be Jehovah out of Zion, Who dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye Jehovah.
