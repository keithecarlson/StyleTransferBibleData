1 It is a good thing to give thanks unto Jehovah, And to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High;
2 To show forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, And thy faithfulness every night,
3 With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery; With a solemn sound upon the harp.
4 For thou, Jehovah, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
5 How great are thy works, O Jehovah! Thy thoughts are very deep.
6 A brutish man knoweth not; Neither doth a fool understand this:
7 When the wicked spring as the grass, And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; It is that they shall be destroyed for ever.
8 But thou, O Jehovah, art on high for evermore.
9 For, lo, thine enemies, O Jehovah, For, lo, thine enemies shall perish; All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
10 But my horn hast thou exalted like the horn of the wild-ox: I am anointed with fresh oil.
11 Mine eye also hath seen my desire on mine enemies, Mine ears have heard my desire of the evil-doers that rise up against me.
12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree: He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
13 They are planted in the house of Jehovah; They shall flourish in the courts of our God.
14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; They shall be full of sap and green:
15 To show that Jehovah is upright; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
