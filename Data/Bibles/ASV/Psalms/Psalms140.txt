1 Deliver me, O Jehovah, from the evil man; Preserve me from the violent man:
2 Who devise mischiefs in their heart; Continually do they gather themselves together for war.
3 They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent; Adders' poison is under their lips. Selah
4 Keep me, O Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked; Preserve me from the violent man: Who have purposed to thrust aside my steps.
5 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; They have spread a net by the wayside; They have set gins for me. Selah
6 I said unto Jehovah, Thou art my God: Give ear unto the voice of my supplications, O Jehovah.
7 O Jehovah the Lord, the strength of my salvation, Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.
8 Grant not, O Jehovah, the desires of the wicked; Further not his evil device, lest they exalt themselves. Selah
9 As for the head of those that compass me about, Let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
10 Let burning coals fall upon them: Let them be cast into the fire, Into deep pits, whence they shall not rise.
11 An evil speaker shall not be established in the earth: Evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
12 I know that Jehovah will maintain the cause of the afflicted, And justice for the needy.
13 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: The upright shall dwell in thy presence.
