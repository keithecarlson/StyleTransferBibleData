1 I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains: From whence shall my help come?
2 My help cometh from Jehovah, Who made heaven and earth.
3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: He that keepeth thee will not slumber.
4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel Will neither slumber nor sleep.
5 Jehovah is thy keeper: Jehovah is thy shade upon thy right hand.
6 The sun shall not smite thee by day, Nor the moon by night.
7 Jehovah will keep thee from all evil; He will keep thy soul.
8 Jehovah will keep thy going out and thy coming in From this time forth and for evermore.
