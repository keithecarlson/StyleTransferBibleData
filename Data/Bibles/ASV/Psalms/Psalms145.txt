1 I will extol thee, my God, O King; And I will bless thy name for ever and ever.
2 Every day will I bless thee; And I will praise thy name for ever and ever.
3 Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised; And his greatness is unsearchable.
4 One generation shall laud thy works to another, And shall declare thy mighty acts.
5 Of the glorious majesty of thine honor, And of thy wondrous works, will I meditate.
6 And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts; And I will declare thy greatness.
7 They shall utter the memory of thy great goodness, And shall sing of thy righteousness.
8 Jehovah is gracious, and merciful; Slow to anger, and of great lovingkindness.
9 Jehovah is good to all; And his tender mercies are over all his works.
10 All thy works shall give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah; And thy saints shall bless thee.
11 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, And talk of thy power;
12 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, And the glory of the majesty of his kingdom.
13 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, And thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.
14 Jehovah upholdeth all that fall, And raiseth up all those that are bowed down.
15 The eyes of all wait for thee; And thou givest them their food in due season.
16 Thou openest thy hand, And satisfiest the desire of every living thing.
17 Jehovah is righteous in all his ways, And gracious in all his works.
18 Jehovah is nigh unto all them that call upon him, To all that call upon him in truth.
19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; He also will hear their cry and will save them.
20 Jehovah preserveth all them that love him; But all the wicked will he destroy.
21 My mouth shall speak the praise of Jehovah; And let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
