1 Jehovah is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? Jehovah is the strength of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid?
2 When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh, Even mine adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.
3 Though a host should encamp against me, My heart shall not fear: Though war should rise against me, Even then will I be confident.
4 One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek after: That I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, To behold the beauty of Jehovah, And to inquire in his temple.
5 For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion: In the covert of his tabernacle will he hide me; He will lift me up upon a rock.
6 And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me; And I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto Jehovah.
7 Hear, O Jehovah, when I cry with my voice: Have mercy also upon me, and answer me.
8 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Jehovah, will I seek.
9 Hide not thy face from me; Put not thy servant away in anger: Thou hast been my help; Cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.
10 When my father and my mother forsake me, Then Jehovah will take me up.
11 Teach me thy way, O Jehovah; And lead me in a plain path, Because of mine enemies.
12 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine adversaries: For false witnesses are risen up against me, And such as breathe out cruelty.
13 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of Jehovah In the land of the living.
14 Wait for Jehovah: Be strong, and let thy heart take courage; Yea, wait thou for Jehovah.
