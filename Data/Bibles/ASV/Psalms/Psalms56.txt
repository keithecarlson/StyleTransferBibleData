1 Be merciful unto me, O God; for man would swallow me up: All the day long he fighting oppresseth me.
2 Mine enemies would swallow me up all the day long; For they are many that fight proudly against me.
3 What time I am afraid, I will put my trust in thee.
4 In God (I will praise his word), In God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid; What can flesh do unto me?
5 All the day long they wrest my words: All their thoughts are against me for evil.
6 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, They mark my steps, Even as they have waited for my soul.
7 Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, O God.
8 Thou numberest my wanderings: Put thou my tears into thy bottle; Are they not in thy book?
9 Then shall mine enemies turn back in the day that I call: This I know, that God is for me.
10 In God (I will praise his word), In Jehovah (I will praise his word),
11 In God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid; What can man do unto me?
12 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render thank-offerings unto thee.
13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: Hast thou not delivered my feet from falling, That I may walk before God In the light of the living?
