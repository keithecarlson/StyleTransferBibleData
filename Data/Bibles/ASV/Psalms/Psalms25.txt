1 Unto thee, O Jehovah, do I lift up my soul.
2 O my God, in thee have I trusted, Let me not be put to shame; Let not mine enemies triumph over me.
3 Yea, none that wait for thee shall be put to shame: They shall be put to shame that deal treacherously without cause.
4 Show me thy ways, O Jehovah; Teach me thy paths.
5 Guide me in thy truth, and teach me; For thou art the God of my salvation; For thee do I wait all the day.
6 Remember, O Jehovah, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindness; For they have been ever of old.
7 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: According to thy lovingkindness remember thou me, For thy goodness' sake, O Jehovah.
8 Good and upright is Jehovah: Therefore will he instruct sinners in the way.
9 The meek will he guide in justice; And the meek will he teach his way.
10 All the paths of Jehovah are lovingkindness and truth Unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
11 For thy name's sake, O Jehovah, Pardon mine iniquity, for it is great.
12 What man is he that feareth Jehovah? Him shall he instruct in the way that he shall choose.
13 His soul shall dwell at ease; And his seed shall inherit the land.
14 The friendship of Jehovah is with them that fear him; And he will show them his covenant.
15 Mine eyes are ever toward Jehovah; For he will pluck my feet out of the net.
16 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; For I am desolate and afflicted.
17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: Oh bring thou me out of my distresses.
18 Consider mine affliction and my travail; And forgive all my sins.
19 Consider mine enemies, for they are many; And they hate me with cruel hatred.
20 Oh keep my soul, and deliver me: Let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in thee.
21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, For I wait for thee.
22 Redeem Israel, O God, Out of all his troubles.
