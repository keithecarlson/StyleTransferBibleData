1 My heart overfloweth with a goodly matter; I speak the things which I have made touching the king: My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
2 Thou art fairer than the children of men; Grace is poured into thy lips: Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
3 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one, Thy glory and thy majesty.
4 And in thy majesty ride on prosperously, Because of truth and meekness and righteousness: And thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
5 Thine arrows are sharp; The peoples fall under thee; They are in the heart of the king's enemies.
6 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: A sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
7 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness: Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee With the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia; Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad.
9 Kings' daughters are among thy honorable women: At thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; Forget also thine own people, and thy father's house:
11 So will the king desire thy beauty; For he is thy lord; and reverence thou him.
12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; The rich among the people shall entreat thy favor.
13 The king's daughter within the palace is all glorious: Her clothing is inwrought with gold.
14 She shall be led unto the king in broidered work: The virgins her companions that follow her Shall be brought unto thee.
15 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be led: They shall enter into the king's palace.
16 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, Whom thou shalt make princes in all the earth.
17 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: Therefore shall the peoples give thee thanks for ever and ever.
