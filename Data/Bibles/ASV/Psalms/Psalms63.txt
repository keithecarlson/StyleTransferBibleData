1 O God, thou art my God; earnestly will I seek thee: My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee, In a dry and weary land, where no water is.
2 So have I looked upon thee in the sanctuary, To see thy power and thy glory.
3 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, My lips shall praise thee.
4 So will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.
5 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; And my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips;
6 When I remember thee upon my bed, And meditate on thee in the night-watches.
7 For thou hast been my help, And in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
8 My soul followeth hard after thee: Thy right hand upholdeth me.
9 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, Shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
10 They shall be given over to the power of the sword: They shall be a portion for foxes.
11 But the king shall rejoice in God: Every one that sweareth by him shall glory; For the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
