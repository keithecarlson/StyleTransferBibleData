1 65 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion; And unto thee shall the vow be performed.
2 O thou that hearest prayer, Unto thee shall all flesh come.
3 Iniquities prevail against me: As for our transgressions, thou wilt forgive them.
4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, That he may dwell in thy courts: We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, Thy holy temple.
5 By terrible things thou wilt answer us in righteousness, O God of our salvation, Thou that art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, And of them that are afar off upon the sea:
6 Who by his strength setteth fast the mountains, Being girded about with might;
7 Who stilleth the roaring of the seas, The roaring of their waves, And the tumult of the peoples.
8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
9 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it, Thou greatly enrichest it; The river of God is full of water: Thou providest them grain, when thou hast so prepared the earth.
10 Thou waterest its furrows abundantly; Thou settlest the ridges thereof: Thou makest it soft with showers; Thou blessest the springing thereof.
11 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; And thy paths drop fatness.
12 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness; And the hills are girded with joy.
13 The pastures are clothed with flocks; The valleys also are covered over with grain; They shout for joy, they also sing.
