1 O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth, Who hast set thy glory upon the heavens!
2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established strength, Because of thine adversaries, That thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
3 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that thou visitest him?
5 For thou hast made him but little lower than God, And crownest him with glory and honor.
6 Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet:
7 All sheep and oxen, Yea, and the beasts of the field,
8 The birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, Whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.
9 O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth!
