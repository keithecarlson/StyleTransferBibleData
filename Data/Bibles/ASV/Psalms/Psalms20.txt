1 Jehovah answer thee in the day of trouble; The name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high;
2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, And strengthen thee out of Zion;
3 Remember all thy offerings, And accept thy burnt-sacrifice; Selah
4 Grant thee thy heart's desire, And fulfil all thy counsel.
5 We will triumph in thy salvation, And in the name of our God we will set up our banners: Jehovah fulfil all thy petitions.
6 Now know I that Jehovah saveth his anointed; He will answer him from his holy heaven With the saving strength of his right hand.
7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; But we will make mention of the name of Jehovah our God.
8 They are bowed down and fallen; But we are risen, and stand upright.
9 Save, Jehovah: Let the King answer us when we call.
