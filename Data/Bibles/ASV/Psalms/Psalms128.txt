1 Blessed is every one that feareth Jehovah, That walketh in his ways.
2 For thou shalt eat the labor of thy hands: Happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
3 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, In the innermost parts of thy house; Thy children like olive plants, Round about thy table.
4 Behold, thus shall the man be blessed That feareth Jehovah.
5 Jehovah bless thee out of Zion: And see thou the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
6 Yea, see thou thy children's children. Peace be upon Israel.
