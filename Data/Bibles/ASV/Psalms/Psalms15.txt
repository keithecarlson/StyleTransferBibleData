1 Jehovah, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill?
2 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, And speaketh truth in his heart;
3 He that slandereth not with his tongue, Nor doeth evil to his friend, Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor;
4 In whose eyes a reprobate is despised, But who honoreth them that fear Jehovah; He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not;
5 He that putteth not out his money to interest, Nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
