1 129 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up, Let Israel now say,
2 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up: Yet they have not prevailed against me.
3 The plowers plowed upon my back; They made long their furrows.
4 Jehovah is righteous: He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
5 Let them be put to shame and turned backward, All they that hate Zion.
6 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, Which withereth before it groweth up;
7 Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand, Nor he that bindeth sheaves, his bosom:
8 Neither do they that go by say, The blessing of Jehovah be upon you; We bless you in the name of Jehovah.
