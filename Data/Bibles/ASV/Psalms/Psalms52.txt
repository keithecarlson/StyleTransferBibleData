1 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? The lovingkindness of God endureth continually.
2 Thy tongue deviseth very wickedness, Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
3 Thou lovest evil more than good, And lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah
4 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.
5 God will likewise destroy thee for ever; He will take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent, And root thee out of the land of the living. Selah
6 The righteous also shall see it, and fear, And shall laugh at him, saying,
7 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength, But trusted in the abundance of his riches, And strengthened himself in his wickedness.
8 But as for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: I trust in the lovingkindness of God for ever and ever.
9 I will give thee thanks for ever, because thou hast done it; And I will hope in thy name, for it is good, in the presence of thy saints.
