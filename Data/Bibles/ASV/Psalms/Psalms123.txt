1 Unto thee do I lift up mine eyes, O thou that sittest in the heavens.
2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their master, As the eyes of a maid unto the hand of her mistress; So our eyes look unto Jehovah our God, Until he have mercy upon us.
3 Have mercy upon us, O Jehovah, have mercy upon us; For we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
4 Our soul is exceedingly filled With the scoffing of those that are at ease, And with the contempt of the proud.
