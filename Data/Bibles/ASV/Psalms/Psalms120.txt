1 In my distress I cried unto Jehovah, And he answered me.
2 Deliver my soul, O Jehovah, from lying lips, And from a deceitful tongue.
3 What shall be given unto thee, and what shall be done more unto thee, Thou deceitful tongue?
4 Sharp arrows of the mighty, With coals of juniper.
5 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech, That I dwell among the tents of Kedar!
6 My soul hath long had her dwelling With him that hateth peace.
7 I am for peace: But when I speak, they are for war.
