1 Jehovah, I have called upon thee; make haste unto me: Give ear unto my voice, when I call unto thee.
2 Let my prayer be set forth as incense before thee; The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
3 Set a watch, O Jehovah, before my mouth; Keep the door of my lips.
4 Incline not my heart to any evil thing, To practise deeds of wickedness With men that work iniquity: And let me not eat of their dainties.
5 Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness; And let him reprove me, it shall be as oil upon the head; Let not my head refuse it: For even in their wickedness shall my prayer continue.
6 Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock; And they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
7 As when one ploweth and cleaveth the earth, Our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
8 For mine eyes are unto thee, O Jehovah the Lord: In thee do I take refuge; leave not my soul destitute.
9 Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, And from the gins of the workers of iniquity.
10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, Whilst that I withal escape.
