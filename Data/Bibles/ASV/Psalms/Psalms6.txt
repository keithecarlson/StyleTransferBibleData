1 O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thine anger, Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
2 Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; for I am withered away: O Jehovah, heal me; for my bones are troubled.
3 My soul also is sore troubled: And thou, O Jehovah, how long?
4 Return, O Jehovah, deliver my soul: Save me for thy lovingkindness' sake.
5 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: In Sheol who shall give thee thanks?
6 I am weary with my groaning; Every night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.
7 Mine eye wasteth away because of grief; It waxeth old because of all mine adversaries.
8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; For Jehovah hath heard the voice of my weeping.
9 Jehovah hath heard my supplication; Jehovah will receive my prayer.
10 All mine enemies shall be put to shame and sore troubled: They shall turn back, they shall be put to shame suddenly.
