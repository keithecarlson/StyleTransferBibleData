1 Hear the right, O Jehovah, attend unto my cry; Give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.
2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; Let thine eyes look upon equity.
3 Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast visited me in the night; Thou hast tried me, and findest nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.
4 As for the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the ways of the violent.
5 My steps have held fast to thy paths, My feet have not slipped.
6 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God: Incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.
7 Show thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them that take refuge in thee From those that rise up against them.
8 Keep me as the apple of the eye; Hide me under the shadow of thy wings,
9 From the wicked that oppress me, My deadly enemies, that compass me about.
10 They are inclosed in their own fat: With their mouth they speak proudly.
11 They have now compassed us in our steps; They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.
12 He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, And as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
13 Arise, O Jehovah, Confront him, cast him down: Deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword;
14 From men by thy hand, O Jehovah, From men of the world, whose portion is in this life, And whose belly thou fillest with thy treasure: They are satisfied with children, And leave the rest of their substance to their babes.
15 As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with beholding thy form.
