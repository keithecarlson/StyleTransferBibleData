1 149 Praise ye Jehovah. Sing unto Jehovah a new song, And his praise in the assembly of the saints.
2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.
3 Let them praise his name in the dance: Let them sing praises unto him with timbrel and harp.
4 For Jehovah taketh pleasure in his people: He will beautify the meek with salvation.
5 Let the saints exult in glory: Let them sing for joy upon their beds.
6 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand;
7 To execute vengeance upon the nations, And punishments upon the peoples;
8 To bind their kings with chains, And their nobles with fetters of iron;
9 To execute upon them the judgment written: This honor have all his saints. Praise ye Jehovah.
