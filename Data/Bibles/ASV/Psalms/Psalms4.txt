1 Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness; Thou hast set me at large when I was in distress: Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
2 O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? How long will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah
3 But know that Jehovah hath set apart for himself him that is godly: Jehovah will hear when I call unto him.
4 Stand in awe, and sin not: Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah
5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And put your trust in Jehovah.
6 Many there are that say, Who will show us any good? Jehovah, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.
7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, More than they have when their grain and their new wine are increased.
8 In peace will I both lay me down and sleep; For thou, Jehovah, alone makest me dwell in safety.
