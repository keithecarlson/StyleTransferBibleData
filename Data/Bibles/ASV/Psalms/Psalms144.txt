1 Blessed be Jehovah my rock, Who teacheth my hands to war, And my fingers to fight:
2 My lovingkindness, and my fortress, My high tower, and my deliverer; My shield, and he in whom I take refuge; Who subdueth my people under me.
3 Jehovah, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that thou makest account of him?
4 Man is like to vanity: His days are as a shadow that passeth away.
5 Bow thy heavens, O Jehovah, and come down: Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
6 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them; Send out thine arrows, and discomfit them.
7 Stretch forth thy hand from above; Rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, Out of the hand of aliens;
8 Whose mouth speaketh deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.
10 Thou art he that giveth salvation unto kings; Who rescueth David his servant from the hurtful sword.
11 Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of aliens, Whose mouth speaketh deceit, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
12 When our sons shall be as plants grown up in their youth, And our daughters as corner-stones hewn after the fashion of a palace;
13 When our garners are full, affording all manner of store, And our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields;
14 When our oxen are well laden; When there is no breaking in, and no going forth, And no outcry in our streets:
15 Happy is the people that is in such a case; Yea, happy is the people whose God is Jehovah.
