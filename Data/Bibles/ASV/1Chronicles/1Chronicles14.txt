1 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house. 
2 And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israel's sake.
3 And David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David begat more sons and daughters. 
4 And these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, 
5 and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet, 
6 and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 
7 and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
8 And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them. 
9 Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim. 
10 And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thy hand. 
11 So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and David said, God hath broken mine enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim. 
12 And they left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.
13 And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley. 
14 And David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Thou shalt not go up after them: turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees. 
15 And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle; for God is gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. 
16 And David did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer. 
17 And the fame of David went out into all lands; and Jehovah brought the fear of him upon all nations.
