62 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood. 
63 And the governor said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.
64 The whole assembly together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore, 
65 besides their men-servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred singing men and singing women. 
66 Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five; 
67 their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
68 And some of the heads of fathers' houses, when they came to the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem, offered willingly for the house of God to set it up in its place: 
69 they gave after their ability into the treasury of the work threescore and one thousand darics of gold, and five thousand pounds of silver, and one hundred priests' garments.
70 So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
