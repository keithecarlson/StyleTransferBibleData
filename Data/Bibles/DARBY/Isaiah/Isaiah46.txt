1 Bel is bowed down, Nebo bendeth; their idols are upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: the things ye carried are laid on, a burden to the weary .
2 They bend, they are bowed down together; they could not deliver the burden, and themselves are gone into captivity.
3 Hearken unto me, house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, ye who have been borne from the belly, who have been carried from the womb:
4 Even to old age, I  HE, and unto hoary hairs I will carry : It is I that have made, and I will bear, and I will carry, and will deliver.
5 To whom will ye liken me and make me equal, or compare me, that we may be like?
6 —They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance; they hire a goldsmith, and he maketh it a god: they fall down, yea, they worship.
7 They bear him on the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place; there he standeth, he doth not remove from his place: yea, one crieth unto him, and he answereth not; he saveth him not out of his trouble.
8 Remember this, and shew yourselves men; call it to mind, ye transgressors.
9 Remember the former things of old; for I  God, and there is none else; [I am] God, and there is none like me;
10 declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure;
11 calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country. Yea, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.
12 Hearken unto me, ye stout-hearted, that are far from righteousness:
13 I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not delay; and I will give salvation in Zion,  unto Israel my glory.
