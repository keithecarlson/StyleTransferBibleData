1 The wilderness and the dry land shall be gladdened; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.
2 It shall blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and shouting: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon. They shall see the glory of Jehovah, the excellency of our God.
3 Strengthen the weak hands and confirm the tottering knees.
4 Say to them that are of a timid heart, Be strong, fear not; behold your God: vengeance cometh, the recompense of God! He will come himself, and save you.
5 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf be unstopped;
6 then shall the lame  leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and torrents in the desert.
7 And the mirage shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of wild dogs, where they lay down, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.
8 And a highway shall be there and a way, and it shall be called, The way of holiness: the unclean shall not pass through it; but it shall be for these. Those that go  way—even fools,—shall not err .
9 No lion shall be there, nor shall ravenous beast go up thereon, nor be found there; but the redeemed shall walk .
10 And the ransomed of Jehovah shall return, and come to Zion with singing; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
