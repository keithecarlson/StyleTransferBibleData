1 O Israel, return unto Jehovah thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.
2 Take with you words, and turn to Jehovah; say unto him, Forgive all iniquity, and receive  graciously; so will we render the calves of our lips.
3 Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, [Thou art] our God; because in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.
4 I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for mine anger is turned away from him.
5 I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.
6 His shoots shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree, and his smell as Lebanon.
7 They shall return and sit under his shadow; they shall revive  corn, and blossom as the vine: the renown thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.
8 Ephraim [shall say], What have I to do any more with idols? (I answer , and I will observe him.) I am like a green fir-tree.—From me is thy fruit found.
9 Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? intelligent, and he shall know them? For the ways of Jehovah are right, and the just shall walk in them; but the transgressors shall fall therein.
