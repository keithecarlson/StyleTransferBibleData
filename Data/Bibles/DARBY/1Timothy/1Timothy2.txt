1 I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made for all men;
2 for kings and all that are in dignity, that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all piety and gravity;
3 for this is good and acceptable before our Saviour God,
4 who desires that all men should be saved and come to  knowledge of  truth.
5 For God is one, and  mediator of God and men one,  man Christ Jesus,
6 who gave himself a ransom for all, the testimony [to be rendered] in its own times;
7 to which *I* have been appointed a herald and apostle, (I speak  truth, I do not lie,) a teacher of  nations in faith and truth.
8 I will therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up pious hands, without wrath or reasoning.
9 In like manner also that the women in decent deportment and dress adorn themselves with modesty and discretion, not with plaited  and gold, or pearls, or costly clothing,
10 but, what becomes women making profession of the fear of God, by good works.
11 Let a woman learn in quietness in all subjection;
12 but I do not suffer a woman to teach nor to exercise authority over man, but to be in quietness;
13 for Adam was formed first, then Eve:
14 and Adam was not deceived; but the woman, having been deceived, was in transgression.
15 But she shall be preserved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with discretion.
