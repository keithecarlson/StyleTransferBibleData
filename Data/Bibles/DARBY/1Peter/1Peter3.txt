1 Likewise, wives,  subject to your own husbands, that, even if any are disobedient to the word, they may be gained without  word by the conversation of the wives,
2 having witnessed your pure conversation [carried out] in fear;
3 whose adorning let it not be that outward one of tressing of hair, and wearing gold, or putting on apparel;
4 but the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible  of a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great price.
5 For thus also the holy women who have hoped in God heretofore adorned themselves, being subject to their own husbands;
6 as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; whose children ye have become, doing good, and not fearing with any kind of consternation.
7  husbands likewise, dwell with  according to knowledge, as with a weaker,  the female, vessel, giving  honour, as also fellow-heirs of  grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered.
8 Finally,  all of one mind, sympathising, full of brotherly love, tender hearted, humble minded;
9 not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing; but on the contrary, blessing , because ye have been called to this, that ye should inherit blessing.
10 For he that will love life and see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips that they speak no guile.
11 And let him avoid evil, and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it;
12 because  eyes of  Lord  on  righteous, and his ears towards their supplications; but  face of  Lord  against them that do evil.
13 And who shall injure you if ye have become imitators of that which  good?
14 But if also ye should suffer for righteousness' sake, blessed [are ye]; but be not afraid of their fear, neither be troubled;
15 but sanctify  Lord the Christ in your hearts, and  always prepared to  an answer  every one that asks you to give an account of the hope that  in you, but with meekness and fear;
16 having a good conscience, that [as to that] in which they speak against you as evildoers, they may be ashamed who calumniate your good conversation in Christ.
17 For [it is] better, if the will of God should will it, to suffer  well-doers than  evildoers;
18 for Christ indeed has once suffered for sins,  just for  unjust, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in flesh, but made alive in  Spirit,
19 in which also going he preached to the spirits [which are] in prison,
20 heretofore disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in  days of Noah while the ark was preparing, into which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:
21 which figure also now saves you,  baptism, not a putting away of  filth of flesh, but  demand as before God of a good conscience, by  resurrection of Jesus Christ,
22 who is at  right hand of God, gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to him.
