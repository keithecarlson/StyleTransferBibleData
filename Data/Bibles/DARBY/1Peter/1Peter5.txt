1 The elders which  among you I exhort, who [am their] fellow-elder and witness of the sufferings of the Christ, who also  partaker of the glory about to be revealed:
2 shepherd the flock of God which  among you, exercising oversight, not by necessity, but willingly; not for base gain, but readily;
3 not as lording it over your possessions, but being models for the flock.
4 And when the chief shepherd is manifested ye shall receive the unfading crown of glory.
5 Likewise  younger, be subject to  elder, and all of you bind on humility towards one another; for God sets himself against  proud, but to  humble gives grace.
6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in [the due] time;
7 having cast all your care upon him, for he cares about you.
8 Be vigilant, watch. Your adversary  devil as a roaring lion walks about seeking whom he may devour.
9 Whom resist, stedfast in faith, knowing that the selfsame sufferings are accomplished in your brotherhood which  in  world.
10 But the God of all grace who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, when ye have suffered for a little while, himself shall make perfect, stablish, strengthen, ground:
11 to him  the glory and the might for the ages of the ages. Amen.
12 By Silvanus, the faithful brother, as I suppose, I have written to you briefly; exhorting and testifying that this is  true grace of God in which ye stand.
13 She that is elected with  in Babylon salutes you, and Marcus my son.
14 Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be with you all who  in Christ.
