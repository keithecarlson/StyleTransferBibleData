1 On my bed, in the nights, I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.
2 I will rise now, and go about the city; In the streets and in the broadways Will I seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.
3 The watchmen that go about the city found me:—Have ye seen him whom my soul loveth?
4 —Scarcely had I passed from them, When I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, Until I had brought him into my mother's house, And into the chamber of her that conceived me.
5 I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles, or by the hinds of the field, That ye stir not up, nor awake  love, till he please.
6 Who is this,  that cometh up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all powders of the merchant? …
7 Behold his couch, Solomon's own: Threescore mighty men are about it, Of the mighty of Israel.
8 They all hold the sword, Experts in war; Each hath his sword upon his thigh Because of alarm in the nights.
9 King Solomon made himself a palanquin Of the wood of Lebanon.
10 Its pillars he made of silver, Its support of gold, Its seat of purple; The midst thereof was paved  love By the daughters of Jerusalem.
11 Go forth, daughters of Zion, And behold king Solomon With the crown wherewith his mother crowned him In the day of his espousals, And in the day of the gladness of his heart.
