1 And Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,
2 Dominion and fear are with him; he maketh peace in his high places.
3 Is there any number of his troops? and upon whom doth not his light arise?
4 And how should man be just with God? Or how should he be clean that is born of a woman?
5 Lo, even the moon is not bright; and the stars are not pure in his sight:
6 How much less man, a worm, and the son of man, a worm!
