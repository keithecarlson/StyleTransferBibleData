1 And these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
2 Then was kindled the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his anger kindled, because he justified himself rather than God;
3 and against his three friends was his anger kindled, because they found no answer, and  condemned Job.
4 But Elihu had waited till Job had finished speaking, because they were older than he.
5 And Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, and his anger was kindled.
6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are aged; wherefore I was timid, and feared to shew you what I know.
7 I said, Let days speak, and multitude of years teach wisdom.
8 But there is a spirit which is in man; and the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
9 It is not the great that are wise; neither do the aged understand judgment.
10 Therefore I say, Hearken to me; I also will shew what I know.
11 Lo, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasonings, until ye searched out what to say.
12 Yea, I gave you mine attention, and behold, there was none of you that confuted Job, that answered his words;
13 That ye may not say, We have found out wisdom; God will make him yield, not man.
14 Now he hath not directed  words against me; and I will not answer him with your speeches. …
15 They were amazed, they answered no more; words failed them.
16 And I waited, for they spoke not, but stood still, and answered no more;—
17 I will answer, I also in my turn, I also will shew what I know:
18 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
19 Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; like new flasks, it is ready to burst.
20 I will speak, that I may find relief; I will open my lips and answer.
21 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person; neither will I give flattery to man.
22 For I know not how to flatter; my Maker would soon take me away.
