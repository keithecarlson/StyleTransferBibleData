1 And Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,
2 How long will ye hunt for words? Be intelligent, and then we will speak.
3 Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed stupid in your sight?
4 Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger, shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of its place?
5 Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the flame of his fire shall not shine.
6 The light shall become dark in his tent, and his lamp over him shall be put out.
7 The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.
8 For he is sent into the net by his own feet, and he walketh on the meshes;
9 The gin taketh  by the heel, the snare layeth hold on him;
10 A cord is hidden for him in the ground, and his trap in the way.
11 Terrors make him afraid on every side, and chase him at his footsteps.
12 His strength is hunger-bitten, and calamity is ready at his side.
13 The firstborn of death devoureth the members of his body; it will devour his members.
14 His confidence shall be rooted out of his tent, and it shall lead him away to the king of terrors:
15 They who are none of his shall dwell in his tent; brimstone shall be showered upon his habitation:
16 His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off;
17 His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name on the pasture-grounds.
18 He is driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.
19 He hath neither son nor grandson among his people, nor any remaining in the places of his sojourn.
20 They that come after shall be astonished at his day, as they that went before  were affrighted.
21 Surely, such are the dwellings of the unrighteous man, and such the place of him that knoweth not God.
