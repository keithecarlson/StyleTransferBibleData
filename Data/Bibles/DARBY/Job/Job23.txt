1 And Job answered and said,
2 Even to-day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
3 Oh that I knew where I might find him, that I might come to his seat!
4 I would order the cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments;
5 I would know the words he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.
6 Would he plead against me with  great power? Nay; but he would give heed unto me.
7 There would an upright man reason with him; and I should be delivered for ever from my judge.
8 Lo, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I do not perceive him;
9 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I behold  not; he hideth himself on the right hand, and I see  not.
10 But he knoweth the way that I take; he trieth me, I shall come forth as gold.
11 My foot hath held to his steps; his way have I kept, and not turned aside.
12 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have laid up the words of his mouth more than the purpose of my own heart.
13 But he is in one , and who can turn him? And what his soul desireth, that will he do.
14 For he will perform  is appointed for me; and many such things are with him.
15 Therefore am I troubled at his presence; I consider, and I am afraid of him.
16 For God hath made my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me;
17 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he hidden the gloom from me.
