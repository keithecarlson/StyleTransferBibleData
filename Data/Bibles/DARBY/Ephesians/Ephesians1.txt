1 Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, to the saints and faithful in Christ Jesus who are at Ephesus.
2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and  Lord Jesus Christ.
3 Blessed  the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ;
4 according as he has chosen us in him before  world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love;
5 having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
6 to  praise of  glory of his grace, wherein he has taken us into favour in the Beloved:
7 in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of offences, according to the riches of his grace;
8 which he has caused to abound towards us in all wisdom and intelligence,
9 having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself
10 for  administration of the fulness of times; to head up all things in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth; in him,
11 in whom we have also obtained an inheritance, being marked out beforehand according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his own will,
12 that we should be to  praise of his glory who have pre-trusted in the Christ:
13 in whom *ye* also [have trusted], having heard the word of the truth, the glad tidings of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,
14 who is  earnest of our inheritance to the redemption of the acquired possession to  praise of his glory.
15 Wherefore *I* also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which  in you, and the love which [ye have] towards all the saints,
16 do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention [of you] at my prayers,
17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give you  spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him,
18 being enlightened in the eyes of your heart, so that ye should know what is the hope of his calling,  what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
19 and what the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe, according to the working of the might of his strength,
20  which he wrought in the Christ  raising him from among  dead, and he set him down at his right hand in the heavenlies,
21 above every principality, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name named, not only in this age, but also in that to come;
22 and has put all things under his feet, and gave him [to be] head over all things to the assembly,
23 which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all:
