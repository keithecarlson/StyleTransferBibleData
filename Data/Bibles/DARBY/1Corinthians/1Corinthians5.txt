1 It is universally reported [that there is] fornication among you, and such fornication as  not even among the nations, so that one should have his father's wife.
2 And *ye* are puffed up, and ye have not rather mourned, in order that he that has done this deed might be taken away out of the midst of you.
3 For *I*,  absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged as present,
4 [to deliver,] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (ye and my spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ), him that has so wrought this:
5 to deliver him, [I say,]  such, to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
6 Your boasting  not good. Do ye not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
7 Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, according as ye are unleavened. For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed;
8 so that let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and wickedness, but with unleavened  of sincerity and truth.
9 I have written to you in the epistle not to mix with fornicators;
10 not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the avaricious and rapacious, or idolaters, since  ye should go out of the world.
11 But now I have written to you, if any one called brother be fornicator, or avaricious, or idolater, or abusive, or a drunkard, or rapacious, not to mix with ; with such a one not even to eat.
12 For what have *I* [to do] with judging those outside also? *ye*, do not ye judge them that are within?
13 But those without God judges. Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves.
