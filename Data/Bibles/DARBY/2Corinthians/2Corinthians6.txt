1 But  fellow-workmen, we also beseech that ye receive not the grace of God in vain:
2 (for he says, I have listened to thee in an accepted time, and I have helped thee in a day of salvation: behold, now [is the] well-accepted time; behold, now  day of salvation:)
3 giving no manner of offence in anything, that the ministry be not blamed;
4 but in everything commending ourselves as God's ministers, in much endurance, in afflictions, in necessities, in straits,
5 in stripes, in prisons, in riots, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,
6 in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in  Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,
7 in  word of truth, in  power of God; through the arms of righteousness on the right hand and left,
8 through glory and dishonour, through evil report and good report: as deceivers, and true;
9 as unknown, and well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as disciplined, and not put to death;
10 as grieved, but always rejoicing; as poor, but enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things.
11 Our mouth is opened to you, Corinthians, our heart is expanded.
12 Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your affections;
13 but for an answering recompense, (I speak as to children,) let *your* heart also expand itself.
14 Be not diversely yoked with unbelievers; for what participation [is there] between righteousness and lawlessness? or what fellowship of light with darkness?
15 and what consent of Christ with Beliar, or what part for a believer along with an unbeliever?
16 and what agreement of God's temple with idols? for *ye* are  living God's temple; according as God has said, I will dwell among them, and walk among ; and I will be their God, and they shall be to me a people.
17 Wherefore come out from the midst of them, and be separated, saith  Lord, and touch not [what is] unclean, and *I* will receive you;
18 and I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith  Lord Almighty.
