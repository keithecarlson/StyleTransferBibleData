1 The elder to  elect lady and her children, whom *I* love in truth, and not *I* only but also all who have known the truth,
2 for the truth's sake which abides in us and shall be with us to eternity.
3 Grace shall be with you, mercy, peace from God  Father, and from  Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
4 I rejoiced greatly that I have found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received commandment from the Father.
5 And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we have had from  beginning, that we should love one another.
6 And this is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, according as ye have heard from the beginning, that ye might walk in it.
7 For many deceivers have gone out into the world, they who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in flesh—this is the deceiver and the antichrist.
8 See to yourselves, that we may not lose what we have wrought, but may receive full wages.
9 Whosoever goes forward and abides not in the doctrine of the Christ has not God. He that abides in the doctrine, *he* has both the Father and the Son.
10 If any one come to you and bring not this doctrine, do not receive him into  house, and greet him not;
11 for he who greets him partakes in his wicked works.
12 Having many things to write to you, I would not with paper and ink; but hope to come to you, and to speak mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full.
13 The children of thine elect sister greet thee.
