1 God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets,
2 at the end of these days has spoken to us in [the person of the] Son, whom he has established heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
3 who being  effulgence of his glory and  expression of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, having made [by himself] the purification of sins, set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high,
4 taking a place by so much better than the angels, as he inherits a name more excellent than they.
5 For to which of the angels said he ever, *Thou* art my Son: this day have *I* begotten thee? and again, *I* will be to him for father, and *he* shall be to me for son?
6 and again, when he brings in the firstborn into the habitable world, he says, And let all God's angels worship him.
7 And as to the angels he says, Who makes his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire;
8 but as to the Son, Thy throne, O God,  to the age of the age, and a sceptre of uprightness  the sceptre of thy kingdom.
9 Thou hast loved righteousness and hast hated lawlessness; therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with oil of gladness above thy companions.
10 And, *Thou* in the beginning, Lord, hast founded the earth, and works of thy hands are the heavens.
11 They shall perish, but *thou* continuest still; and they all shall grow old as a garment,
12 and as a covering shalt thou roll them up, and they shall be changed; but *thou* art the Same, and thy years shall not fail.
13 But as to which of the angels said he ever, Sit at my right hand until I put thine enemies  footstool of thy feet?
14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation?
