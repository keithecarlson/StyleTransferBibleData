1 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased: restore us again.
2 Thou hast made the earth to tremble, thou hast rent it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.
3 Thou hast shewn thy people hard things; thou hast made us to drink the wine of bewilderment.
4 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth, (Selah,)
5 That thy beloved ones may be delivered. Save with thy right hand, and answer me.
6 God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine, and Ephraim is the strength of my head; Judah is my law-giver;
8 Moab is my wash-pot; upon Edom will I cast my sandal; Philistia, shout aloud because of me.
9 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me unto Edom?
10  not thou, O God, who didst cast us off? and didst not go forth, O God, with our armies?
11 Give us help from trouble; for vain is man's deliverance.
12 Through God we shall do valiantly; and he it is that will tread down our adversaries.
