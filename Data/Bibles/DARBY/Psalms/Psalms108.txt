1 My heart is fixed, O God: I will sing, yea, I will sing psalms, even  my glory.
2 Awake, lute and harp: I will wake the dawn.
3 I will give thee thanks among the peoples, O Jehovah; of thee will I sing psalms among the nations:
4 For thy loving-kindness is great above the heavens, and thy truth is unto the clouds.
5 Be thou exalted above the heavens, O God, and thy glory above all the earth.
6 That thy beloved ones may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me.
7 God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
8 Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine, and Ephraim is the strength of my head; Judah is my law-giver;
9 Moab is my wash-pot; upon Edom will I cast my sandal; over Philistia will I shout aloud.
10 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me unto Edom?
11  not , O God, who didst cast us off? and didst not go forth, O God, with our armies?
12 Give us help from trouble; for vain is man's deliverance.
13 Through God we shall do valiantly; and he it is that will tread down our adversaries.
