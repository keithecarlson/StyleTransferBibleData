1 Upon God alone doth my soul rest peacefully; from him is my salvation.
2 He only is my rock and my salvation; my high fortress: I shall not be greatly moved.
3 How long will ye assail a man; will ye , all of you, to break him down as a bowing wall or a tottering fence?
4 They only consult to thrust  down from his excellency; they delight in lies; they bless with their mouth, but in their inward part they curse. Selah.
5 Upon God alone, O my soul, rest peacefully; for my expectation is from him.
6 He only is my rock and my salvation; my high fortress: I shall not be moved.
7 With God is my salvation and my glory; the rock of my strength, my refuge is in God.
8 Confide in him at all times, ye people; pour out your heart before him: God is our refuge. Selah.
9 Men of low degree are only vanity; men of high degree, a lie: laid in the balance, they go up together  than vanity.
10 Put not confidence in oppression, and become not vain in robbery; if wealth increase, set not your heart upon it.
11 Once hath God spoken, twice have I heard this, that strength  unto God.
12 And unto thee, O Lord,  loving-kindness; for *thou* renderest to every man according to his work.
