1 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee. My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh languisheth for thee, in a dry and weary land without water:
2 To see thy power and thy glory, as I have beheld thee in the sanctuary;
3 For thy loving-kindness is better than life: my lips shall praise thee.
4 So will I bless thee while I live; I will lift up my hands in thy name.
5 My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise  with joyful lips.
6 When I remember thee upon my bed, I meditate on thee in the night-watches:
7 For thou hast been my help, and in the shadow of thy wings will I sing for joy.
8 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.
9 But those that seek my soul, to destroy , shall go into the lower parts of the earth;
10 They shall be given over to the power of the sword; they shall be the portion of foxes.
11 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
