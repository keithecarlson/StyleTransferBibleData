1 Sing ye unto Jehovah a new song: sing unto Jehovah, all the earth.
2 Sing unto Jehovah, bless his name; publish his salvation from day to day.
3 Declare his glory among the nations, his wondrous works among all the peoples.
4 For Jehovah is great and exceedingly to be praised; he is terrible above all gods.
5 For all the gods of the peoples are idols; but Jehovah made the heavens.
6 Majesty and splendour are before him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
7 Give unto Jehovah, ye families of peoples, give unto Jehovah glory and strength;
8 Give unto Jehovah the glory of his name; bring an oblation and come into his courts;
9 Worship Jehovah in holy splendour; tremble before him, all the earth.
10 Say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth! yea, the world is established, it shall not be moved; he will execute judgment upon the peoples with equity.
11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
12 Let the field exult and all that is therein. Then shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy,
13 Before Jehovah, for he cometh; for he cometh to judge the earth: he will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples in his faithfulness.
