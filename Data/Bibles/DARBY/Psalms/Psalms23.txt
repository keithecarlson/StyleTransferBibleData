1 Jehovah is my shepherd; I shall not want.
2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me beside still waters.
3 He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou hast anointed my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
6 Surely, goodness and loving-kindness shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of Jehovah for the length of the days.
