1 Jehovah, remember for David all his affliction;
2 How he swore unto Jehovah, vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob:
3 I will not come into the tent of my house, I will not go up to the couch of my bed;
4 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, slumber to mine eyelids,
5 Until I find out a place for Jehovah, habitations for the Mighty One of Jacob. …
6 Behold, we heard of it at Ephratah, we found it in the fields of the wood.
7 Let us go into his habitations, let us worship at his footstool.
8 Arise, Jehovah, into thy rest, thou and the ark of thy strength.
9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness, and let thy saints shout for joy.
10 For thy servant David's sake, turn not away the face of thine anointed.
11 Jehovah hath sworn  truth unto David; he will not turn from it: Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne;
12 If thy children keep my covenant, and my testimonies which I will teach them, their children also for evermore shall sit upon thy throne.
13 For Jehovah hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his dwelling:
14 This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell, for I have desired it.
15 I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her needy ones with bread;
16 And I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
17 There will I cause the horn of David to bud forth; I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.
18 His enemies will I clothe with shame; but upon himself shall his crown flourish.
