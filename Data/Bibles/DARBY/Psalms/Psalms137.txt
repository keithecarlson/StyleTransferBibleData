1 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down; yea, we wept when we remembered Zion.
2 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.
3 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that made us wail  mirth, [saying,] Sing us  of the songs of Zion.
4 How should we sing a song of Jehovah's upon a foreign soil?
5 If I forget thee, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget [its skill];
6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to my palate: if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.
7 Remember, O Jehovah, against the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem; who said, Lay  bare, Lay  bare, down to its foundation!
8 Daughter of Babylon, who art to be laid waste, happy he that rendereth unto thee that which thou hast meted out to us.
9 Happy he that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the rock.
