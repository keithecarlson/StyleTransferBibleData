1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
2 I say of Jehovah, My refuge and my fortress; my God, I will confide in him.
3 Surely *he* shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler,  from the destructive pestilence.
4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou find refuge: his truth is a shield and buckler.
5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, for the arrow that flieth by day,
6 For the pestilence that walketh in darkness, for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand;  it shall not come nigh thee.
8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, and see the reward of the wicked.
9 Because *thou* hast made Jehovah, my refuge, the Most High, thy dwelling-place,
10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent.
11 For he shall give his angels charge concerning thee, to keep thee in all thy ways:
12 They shall bear thee up in  hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder; the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under foot.
14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him; I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honour him.
16 With length of days will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
