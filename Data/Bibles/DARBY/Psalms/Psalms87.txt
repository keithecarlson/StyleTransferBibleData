2 Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion more than all the habitations of Jacob.
3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.
4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon among them that know me; behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia: this  was born there.
5 And of Zion it shall be said, This one and that one was born in her; and the Most High himself shall establish her.
6 Jehovah will count, when he inscribeth the peoples, This  was born there. Selah.
7 As well the singers as the dancers [shall say], All my springs are in thee.
