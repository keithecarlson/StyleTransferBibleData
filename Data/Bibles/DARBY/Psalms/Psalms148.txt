1 Hallelujah! Praise Jehovah from the heavens; praise him in the heights.
2 Praise ye him, all his angels; praise ye him, all his hosts.
3 Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all ye stars of light.
4 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that are above the heavens.
5 Let them praise the name of Jehovah, for he it is that commanded, and they were created:
6 And he established them for ever and ever; he made [for them] a statute which shall not pass.
7 Praise Jehovah from the earth, ye sea-monsters, and all deeps;
8 Fire and hail, snow and vapour, stormy wind fulfilling his word;
9 Mountains and all hills, fruit-trees and all cedars;
10 Beasts and all cattle, creeping things and winged fowl;
11 Kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all judges of the earth;
12 Both young men and maidens, old men with youths,—
13 Let them praise the name of Jehovah: for his name alone is exalted; his majesty is above the earth and the heavens.
14 And he hath lifted up the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints,  of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Hallelujah!
