1 Jehovah, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; neither do I exercise myself in great matters, and in things too wonderful for me.
2 Surely I have restrained and composed my soul, like a weaned child with its mother: my soul within me is as a weaned child.
3 Let Israel hope in Jehovah, from henceforth and for evermore.
