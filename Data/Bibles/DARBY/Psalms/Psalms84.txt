1 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Jehovah of hosts!
2 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of Jehovah; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
3 Yea, the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she layeth her young, thine altars, O Jehovah of hosts, my King and my God.
4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be constantly praising thee. Selah.
5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee,—they, in whose heart are the highways.
6 Passing through the valley of Baca, they make it a well-spring; yea, the early rain covereth it with blessings.
7 They go from strength to strength: [each one] will appear before God in Zion.
8 Jehovah, God of hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.
9 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.
10 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God, than dwell in the tents of wickedness.
11 For Jehovah Elohim is a sun and shield: Jehovah will give grace and glory; no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
12 Jehovah of hosts, blessed is the man that confideth in thee!
