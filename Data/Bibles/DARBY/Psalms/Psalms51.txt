1 Be gracious unto me, O God, according to thy loving-kindness; according to the abundance of thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.
2 Wash me fully from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
3 For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is continually before me.
4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done what is evil in thy sight; that thou mayest be justified when thou speakest, be clear when thou judgest.
5 Behold, in iniquity was I brought forth, and in sin did my mother conceive me.
6 Behold, thou wilt have truth in the inward parts; and in the hidden  thou wilt make me to know wisdom.
7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
8 Make me to hear gladness and joy;  the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.
9 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
10 Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
11 Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not the spirit of thy holiness from me.
12 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and let a willing spirit sustain me.
13 I will teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall return unto thee.
14 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
15 Lord, open my lips, and my mouth shall declare thy praise.
16 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou hast no pleasure in burnt-offering.
17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
18 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion; build the walls of Jerusalem.
19 Then shalt thou have sacrifices of righteousness, burnt-offering, and whole burnt-offering; then shall they offer up bullocks upon thine altar.
