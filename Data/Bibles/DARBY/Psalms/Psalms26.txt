1 Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in mine integrity, and I have confided in Jehovah: I shall not slip.
2 Prove me, Jehovah, and test me; try my reins and my heart:
3 For thy loving-kindness is before mine eyes, and I have walked in thy truth.
4 I have not sat with vain persons, neither have I gone in with dissemblers;
5 I have hated the congregation of evil-doers, and I have not sat with the wicked.
6 I will wash my hands in innocency, and will encompass thine altar, O Jehovah,
7 That I may cause the voice of thanksgiving to be heard, and declare all thy marvellous works.
8 Jehovah, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thy glory dwelleth.
9 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with men of blood;
10 In whose hands are evil devices, and their right hand is full of bribes.
11 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity. Redeem me, and be gracious unto me.
12 My foot standeth in an even place; in the congregations will I bless Jehovah.
