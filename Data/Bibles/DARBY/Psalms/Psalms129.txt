1 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth—oh let Israel say—
2 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth; yet they have not prevailed against me.
3 The ploughers ploughed upon my back; they made long their furrows.
4 Jehovah is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
5 Let them be ashamed and turned backward, all that hate Zion;
6 Let them be as the grass upon the house-tops, which withereth before it is plucked up,
7 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand, nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom;
8 Neither do the passers-by say, The blessing of Jehovah be upon you; we bless you in the name of Jehovah!
