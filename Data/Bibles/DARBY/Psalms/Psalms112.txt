1 Hallelujah! Blessed is the man that feareth Jehovah, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.
2 His seed shall be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright shall be blessed.
3 Wealth and riches [shall be] in his house; and his righteousness abideth for ever.
4 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness; he is gracious, and merciful, and righteous.
5 It is well with the man that is gracious and lendeth; he will sustain his cause in judgment.
6 For he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.
7 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is fixed confiding in Jehovah;
8 His heart is maintained, he is not afraid, until he see [his desire] upon his oppressors.
9 He scattereth abroad, he giveth to the needy; his righteousness abideth for ever: his horn shall be exalted with honour.
10 The wicked  shall see  and be vexed; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.
