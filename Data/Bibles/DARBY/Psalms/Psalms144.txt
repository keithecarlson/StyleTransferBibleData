1 Blessed be Jehovah my rock, who teacheth my hands to war, my fingers to fight;
2 My mercy and my fortress, my high tower and my deliverer, my shield and he in whom I trust, who subdueth my people under me!
3 Jehovah, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him, the son of man, that thou takest thought of him?
4 Man is like to vanity; his days are as a shadow that passeth away.
5 Jehovah, bow thy heavens, and come down; touch the mountains, that they smoke;
6 Cast forth lightnings, and scatter them; send forth thine arrows, and discomfit them:
7 Stretch out thy hands from above; rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of aliens,
8 Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
9 O God, I will sing a new song unto thee; with the ten-stringed lute will I sing psalms unto thee:
10 Who givest salvation unto kings; who rescuest David thy servant from the hurtful sword.
11 Rescue me, and deliver me from the hand of aliens, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
12 That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; our daughters as corner-columns, sculptured after the fashion of a palace:
13 Our granaries full, affording all manner of store; our sheep bringing forth thousands, ten thousands in our pastures;
14 Our kine laden [with young]; no breaking in and no going forth, and no outcry in our streets.
15 Blessed the people that is in such a case! Blessed the people whose God is Jehovah!
