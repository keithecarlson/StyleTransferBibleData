1 Hear, O God, my cry; attend unto my prayer.
2 From the end of the earth will I call unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: thou wilt lead me on to a rock which is too high for me.
3 For thou hast been a refuge for me, a strong tower from before the enemy.
4 I will sojourn in thy tent for ever; I will take refuge in the covert of thy wings. Selah.
5 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows; thou hast given  the inheritance of those that fear thy name.
6 Thou wilt add days to the days of the king: his years shall be as many generations.
7 He shall abide before God for ever: bestow loving-kindness and truth, that they may preserve him.
8 So will I sing forth thy name for ever, performing my vows from day to day.
