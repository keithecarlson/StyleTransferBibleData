1 Sing ye unto Jehovah a new song: for he hath done wondrous things; his right hand and his holy arm hath wrought salvation for him.
2 Jehovah hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the nations.
3 He hath remembered his loving-kindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
4 Shout aloud unto Jehovah, all the earth; break forth and shout for joy, and sing psalms.
5 Sing psalms unto Jehovah with the harp: with the harp, and the voice of a song;
6 With trumpets and sound of cornet, make a joyful noise before the King, Jehovah.
7 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein;
8 Let the floods clap  hands; let the mountains sing for joy together,
9 Before Jehovah, for he cometh to judge the earth: he will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.
