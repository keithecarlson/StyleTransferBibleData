1 Jehovah reigneth, he hath clothed himself with majesty: Jehovah hath clothed himself, he hath girded himself with strength; yea, the world is established, it shall not be moved.
2 Thy throne is established of old; thou art from eternity.
3 The floods lifted up, O Jehovah, the floods lifted up their voice; the floods lifted up their roaring waves.
4 Jehovah on high is mightier than the voices of many waters, than the mighty breakers of the sea.
5 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thy house, O Jehovah, for ever.
