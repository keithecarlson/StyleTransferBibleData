1 I love Jehovah, for he hath heard my voice  my supplications;
2 For he hath inclined his ear unto me, and I will call upon him during  my days.
3 The bands of death encompassed me, and the anguish of Sheol took hold of me; I found trouble and sorrow:
4 Then called I upon the name of Jehovah: I beseech thee, Jehovah, deliver my soul.
5 Gracious is Jehovah and righteous; and our God is merciful.
6 Jehovah keepeth the simple: I was brought low, and he saved me.
7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for Jehovah hath dealt bountifully with thee.
8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, my feet from falling.
9 I will walk before Jehovah in the land of the living.
10 I believed, therefore have I spoken. As for me, I was greatly afflicted.
11 I said in my haste, All men are liars.
12 What shall I render unto Jehovah,  all his benefits toward me?
13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of Jehovah.
14 I will perform my vows unto Jehovah, yea, before all his people.
15 Precious in the sight of Jehovah is the death of his saints.
16 Yea, Jehovah! for I am thy servant; I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.
17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of Jehovah.
18 I will perform my vows unto Jehovah, yea, before all his people,
19 In the courts of Jehovah's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah!
