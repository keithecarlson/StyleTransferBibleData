1 Blessed is he  transgression is forgiven,  sin is covered!
2 Blessed is the man unto whom Jehovah reckoneth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile!
3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old, through my groaning all the day long.
4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me; my moisture was turned into the drought of summer. Selah.
5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity I covered not; I said, I will confess my transgressions unto Jehovah, and *thou* forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
6 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee at a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they will not reach him.
7 Thou art a hiding-place for me; thou preservest me from trouble; thou dost encompass me with songs of deliverance. Selah.
8 I will instruct thee and teach thee the way in which thou shalt go; I will counsel  with mine eye upon thee.
9 Be ye not as a horse, as a mule, which have no understanding: whose trappings must be bit and bridle, for restraint, or they will not come unto thee.
10 Many sorrows hath the wicked; but he that confideth in Jehovah, loving-kindness shall encompass him.
11 Rejoice in Jehovah, and be glad, ye righteous; and shout for joy, all ye upright in heart.
