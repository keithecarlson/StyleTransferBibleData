1 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language,
2 Judah was his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
3 The sea saw it and fled, the Jordan turned back;
4 The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs.
5 What ailed thee, thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou turnedst back?
6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams? ye hills, like lambs?
7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the +God of Jacob,
8 Who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
