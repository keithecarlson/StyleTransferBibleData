1 Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that sittest  the cherubim, shine forth.
2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy strength, and come to our deliverance.
3 O God, restore us; and cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
4 Jehovah, God of hosts, how long will thine anger smoke against the prayer of thy people?
5 Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure:
6 Thou hast made us a strife unto our neighbours, and our enemies mock among themselves.
7 Restore us, O God of hosts; and cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
8 Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt; thou didst cast out the nations, and plant it:
9 Thou preparedst space before it, and it took deep root, and filled the land;
10 The mountains were covered with its shadow, and the branches thereof were  cedars of God;
11 It sent out its boughs unto the sea, and its shoots unto the river.
12 Why hast thou broken down its fences, so that all who pass by the way do pluck it?
13 The boar out of the forest doth waste it, and the beast of the field doth feed off it.
14 O God of hosts, return, we beseech thee; look down from the heavens, and behold, and visit this vine;
15 Even the stock which thy right hand hath planted, and the young plant thou madest strong for thyself.
16 It is burned with fire, it is cut down; they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou hast made strong for thyself.
18 So will we not go back from thee. Revive us, and we will call upon thy name.
19 Restore us, O Jehovah, God of hosts; cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
