1 I will praise Jehovah with my whole heart; I will recount all thy marvellous works.
2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee; I will sing forth thy name, O Most High.
3 When mine enemies turned back, they stumbled and perished at thy presence:
4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause. Thou sittest on the throne, judging righteously.
5 Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the wicked; thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
6 O enemy! destructions are ended for ever.—Thou hast also destroyed cities, even the remembrance of them hath perished.
7 But Jehovah sitteth for ever; he hath ordained his throne for judgment.
8 And it is he that will judge the world with righteousness; he shall execute judgment upon the peoples with equity.
9 And Jehovah will be a refuge to the oppressed one, a refuge in times of distress.
10 And they that know thy name will confide in thee; for thou, Jehovah, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
11 Sing psalms to Jehovah who dwelleth in Zion; tell among the peoples his doings.
12 For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them; the cry of the afflicted ones hath he not forgotten.
13 Be gracious unto me, O Jehovah; consider mine affliction from them that hate me, lifting me up from the gates of death:
14 That I may declare all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion. I will be joyful in thy salvation.
15 The nations are sunk down in the pit  they made; in the net that they hid is their own foot taken.
16 Jehovah is known  the judgment he hath executed: the wicked is ensnared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.
17 The wicked shall be turned into Sheol, all the nations that forget God.
18 For the needy one shall not be forgotten alway; the hope of the meek shall not perish for ever.
19 Arise, Jehovah; let not man prevail: let the nations be judged in thy sight.
20 Put them in fear, Jehovah: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.
