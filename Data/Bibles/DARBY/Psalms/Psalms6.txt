1 Jehovah, rebuke me not in thine anger, and chasten me not in thy hot displeasure.
2 Be gracious unto me, Jehovah, for I am withered; Jehovah, heal me, for my bones tremble.
3 And my soul trembleth exceedingly: and thou, Jehovah, till how long?
4 Return, Jehovah, free my soul; save me for thy loving-kindness' sake.
5 For in death there is no remembrance of thee; in Sheol who shall give thanks unto thee?
6 I am wearied with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I dissolve my couch with my tears.
7 Mine eye wasteth away through grief; it hath grown old because of all mine oppressors.
8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for Jehovah hath heard the voice of my weeping.
9 Jehovah hath heard my supplication; Jehovah receiveth my prayer.
10 All mine enemies shall be ashamed and tremble exceedingly; they will turn, they will be ashamed suddenly.
