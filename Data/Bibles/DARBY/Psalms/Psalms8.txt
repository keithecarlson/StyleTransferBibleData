1 Jehovah our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy majesty above the heavens.
2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established praise because of thine adversaries, to still the enemy and the avenger.
3 When I see thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and stars, which thou hast established;
4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
5 Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and splendour.
6 Thou hast made him to rule over the works of thy hands; thou hast put everything under his feet:
7 Sheep and oxen, all of them, and also the beasts of the field;
8 The fowl of the heavens, and the fishes of the sea,  passeth through the paths of the seas.
9 Jehovah our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
