1 Shout aloud unto Jehovah, all the earth!
2 Serve Jehovah with joy: come before his presence with exultation.
3 Know that Jehovah is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; [we are] his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving  into his courts with praise; give thanks unto him, bless his name:
5 For Jehovah is good; his loving-kindness  for ever; and his faithfulness from generation to generation.
