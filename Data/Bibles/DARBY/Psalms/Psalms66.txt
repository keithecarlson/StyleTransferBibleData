1 Shout aloud unto God, all the earth:
2 Sing forth the glory of his name, make his praise glorious;
3 Say unto God, How terrible are thy works! because of the greatness of thy strength, thine enemies come cringing unto thee.
4 All the earth shall worship thee, and sing psalms unto thee: they shall sing forth thy name. Selah.
5 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in  doings toward the children of men.
6 He turned the sea into dry ; they went through the river on foot: there did we rejoice in him.
7 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes observe the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.
8 Bless our God, ye peoples, and make the voice of his praise to be heard;
9 Who hath set our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.
10 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.
11 Thou broughtest us into a net, thou didst lay a heavy burden upon our loins;
12 Thou didst cause men to ride over our head; we went through fire and through water: but thou hast brought us out into abundance.
13 I will go into thy house with burnt-offerings; I will perform my vows to thee,
14 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.
15 I will offer up unto thee burnt-offerings of fatted beasts, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.
16 Come, hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.
17 I called unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.
18 Had I regarded iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not hear.
19 But God hath heard; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
20 Blessed be God, who hath not turned away my prayer, nor his loving-kindness from me!
