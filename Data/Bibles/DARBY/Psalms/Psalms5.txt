1 Give ear to my words, O Jehovah; consider my meditation.
2 Hearken unto the voice of my crying, my king and my God; for to thee will I pray.
3 Jehovah, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice; in the morning will I address myself to thee, and will look up.
4 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness; evil shall not sojourn with thee.
5 Insolent fools shall not stand before thine eyes; thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
6 Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies: Jehovah abhorreth a man of blood and deceit.
7 But as for me, in the greatness of thy loving-kindness will I enter thy house; I will bow down toward the temple of thy holiness in thy fear.
8 Lead me, Jehovah, in thy righteousness, because of my foes; make thy way plain before me.
9 For there is no certainty in their mouth; their inward part is perversion, their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.
10 Bring guilt upon them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels: drive them out in the multitude of their transgressions, for they have rebelled against thee.
11 And all that trust in thee shall rejoice: for ever shall they shout joyously, and thou wilt protect them; and they that love thy name shall exult in thee.
12 For thou, Jehovah, wilt bless the righteous ; with favour wilt thou surround him as  a shield.
