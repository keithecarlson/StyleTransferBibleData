1 In Jehovah have I put my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee  a bird to your mountain?
2 For behold, the wicked bend the bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may in darkness shoot at the upright in heart.
3 If the foundations be destroyed, what shall the righteous do?
4 Jehovah  in the temple of his holiness; Jehovah,—his throne is in the heavens: his eyes behold, his eyelids try the children of men.
5 Jehovah trieth the righteous one; but the wicked, and him that loveth violence, his soul hateth.
6 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone; and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.
7 For righteous is Jehovah; he loveth righteousness, his countenance doth behold the upright.
