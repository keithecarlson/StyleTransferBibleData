1 When I call, answer me, O God of my righteousness: in pressure thou hast enlarged me; be gracious unto me, and hear my prayer.
2 Ye sons of men, till when is my glory [to be put] to shame? [How long] will ye love vanity, will ye seek after a lie? Selah.
3 But know that Jehovah hath set apart the pious  for himself: Jehovah will hear when I call unto him.
4 Be moved with anger, and sin not; meditate in your own hearts upon your bed, and be still. Selah.
5 Offer sacrifices of righteousness, and confide in Jehovah.
6 Many say, Who shall cause us to see good? Lift up upon us the light of thy countenance, O Jehovah.
7 Thou hast put joy in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their new wine was in abundance.
8 In peace will I both lay me down and sleep; for thou, Jehovah, alone makest me to dwell in safety.
