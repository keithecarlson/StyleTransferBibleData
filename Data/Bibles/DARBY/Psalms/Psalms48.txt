1 Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the hill of his holiness.
2 Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion,  the sides of the north, the city of the great King.
3 God is known in her palaces as a high fortress.
4 For behold, the kings assembled themselves, they passed by together;
5 They saw,—so they marvelled; they were troubled, they fled in consternation:
6 Trembling took hold upon them there; anguish, as of a woman in travail.
7 With an east wind thou hast broken the ships of Tarshish.
8 As we have heard, so have we seen, in the city of Jehovah of hosts, in the city of our God: God doth establish it for ever. Selah.
9 We have thought, O God, of thy loving-kindness, in the midst of thy temple.
10 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.
11 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.
12 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: count the towers thereof;
13 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces: that ye may tell it to the generation following.
14 For this God is our God for ever and ever; he will be our guide until death.
