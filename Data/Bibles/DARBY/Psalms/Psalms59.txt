1 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God; secure me on high from them that rise up against me.
2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from men of blood.
3 For behold, they lie in wait for my soul; strong ones are gathered against me: not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O Jehovah.
4 They run and prepare themselves without  fault: awake to meet me, and behold.
5 Yea, do thou, Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, arise to visit all the nations: be not gracious to any plotters of iniquity. Selah.
6 They return in the evening; they howl like a dog, and go round about the city:
7 Behold, they belch out with their mouth; swords are in their lips: for who [say they] doth hear?
8 But thou, Jehovah, wilt laugh at them; thou wilt have all the nations in derision.
9 Their strength! … I will take heed to thee; for God is my high fortress.
10 God, whose loving-kindness will come to meet me,—God shall let me see [my desire] upon mine enemies.
11 Slay them not, lest my people forget; by thy power make them wander, and bring them down, O Lord, our shield.
12 [Because of] the sin of their mouth, the word of their lips, let them even be taken in their pride; and because of cursing and lying which they speak.
13 Make an end in wrath, make an end, that they may be no more; that they may know that God ruleth in Jacob, unto the ends of the earth. Selah.
14 And in the evening they shall return, they shall howl like a dog, and go round about the city.
15 They shall wander about for meat, and stay all night if they be not satisfied.
16 But as for me, I will sing of thy strength; yea, I will sing aloud of thy loving-kindness in the morning; for thou hast been to me a high fortress, and a refuge in the day of my trouble.
17 Unto thee, my strength, will I sing psalms; for God is my high fortress, the God of my mercy.
