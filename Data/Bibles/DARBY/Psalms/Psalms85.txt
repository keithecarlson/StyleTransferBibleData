1 Thou hast been favourable, Jehovah, unto thy land; thou hast turned the captivity of Jacob:
2 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people; thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.
3 Thou hast withdrawn all thy wrath; thou hast turned from the fierceness of thine anger.
4 Bring us back, O God of our salvation, and cause thine indignation toward us to cease.
5 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger from generation to generation?
6 Wilt thou not revive us again, that thy people may rejoice in thee?
7 Shew us thy loving-kindness, O Jehovah, and grant us thy salvation.
8 I will hear what God, Jehovah, will speak; for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his godly ones: but let them not turn again to folly.
9 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him, that glory may dwell in our land.
10 Loving-kindness and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other:
11 Truth shall spring out of the earth, and righteousness shall look down from the heavens.
12 Jehovah also will give what is good, and our land shall yield its increase.
13 Righteousness shall go before him, and shall set his footsteps on the way.
