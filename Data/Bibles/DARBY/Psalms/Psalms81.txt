1 Sing ye joyously unto God our strength, shout aloud unto the God of Jacob;
2 Raise a song, and sound the tambour, the pleasant harp with the lute.
3 Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the set time, on our feast day:
4 For this is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob;
5 He ordained it in Joseph  a testimony, when he went forth over the land of Egypt,  I heard a language that I knew not.
6 I removed his shoulder from the burden; his hands were freed from the basket.
7 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
8 Hear, my people, and I will testify unto thee; O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto me!
9 There shall no strange god be in thee, neither shalt thou worship any foreign god.
10 I am Jehovah thy God, that brought thee up out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
11 But my people hearkened not to my voice, and Israel would none of me.
12 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' stubbornness: they walked after their own counsels.
13 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, that Israel had walked in my ways!
14 I would soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.
15 The haters of Jehovah would have come cringing unto him; but their time would have been for ever.
16 And he would have fed them with the finest of wheat; yea, with honey out of the rock would I have satisfied thee.
