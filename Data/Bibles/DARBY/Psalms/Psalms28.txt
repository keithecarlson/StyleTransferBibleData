1 Unto thee, Jehovah, do I call; my rock, be not silent unto me, lest,  thou keep silence toward me, I become like them that go down into the pit.
2 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward the oracle of thy holiness.
3 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace to their neighbours, and mischief is in their heart.
4 Give them according to their doing, and according to the wickedness of their deeds; give them after the work of their hands, render to them their desert.
5 For they regard not the deeds of Jehovah, nor the work of his hands: he will destroy them, and not build them up.
6 Blessed be Jehovah, for he hath heard the voice of my supplications.
7 Jehovah is my strength and my shield; my heart confided in him, and I was helped: therefore my heart exulteth, and with my song will I praise him.
8 Jehovah is their strength; and he is the stronghold of salvation to his anointed one.
9 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance; and feed them, and lift them up for ever.
