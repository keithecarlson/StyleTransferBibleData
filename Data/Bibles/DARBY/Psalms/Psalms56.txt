1 Be gracious unto me, O God; for man would swallow me up: all the day long fighting he oppresseth me.
2 Mine enemies would swallow  up all the day long; for they are many that fight against me haughtily.
3 In the day that I am afraid, I will confide in thee.
4 In God will I praise his word, in God I put my confidence: I will not fear; what can flesh do unto me?
5 All the day long they wrest my words; all their thoughts are against me for evil.
6 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves; they mark my steps, because they wait for my soul.
7 Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, O God.
8 *Thou* countest my wanderings; put my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?
9 Then shall mine enemies return backward in the day when I call: this I know, for God is for me.
10 In God will I praise  word; in Jehovah will I praise  word.
11 In God have I put my confidence: I will not fear; what can man do unto me?
12 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render thanks unto thee.
13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death; [wilt thou] not  my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
