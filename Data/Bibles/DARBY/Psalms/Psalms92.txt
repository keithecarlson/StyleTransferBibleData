1 It is good to give thanks unto Jehovah, and to sing psalms unto thy name, O Most High;
2 To declare thy loving-kindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness in the nights,
3 Upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the lute; upon the Higgaion with the harp.
4 For thou, Jehovah, hast made me glad through thy work; I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
5 Jehovah, how great are thy works! Thy thoughts are very deep:
6 A brutish man knoweth not, neither doth a fool understand it.
7 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity flourish, it is that they may be destroyed for ever.
8 And thou, Jehovah, art on high for evermore.
9 For lo, thine enemies, O Jehovah, for lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like a buffalo's: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
11 And mine eye shall see [its desire] on mine enemies; mine ears shall hear  of the evil-doers that rise up against me.
12 The righteous shall shoot forth like a palm-tree; he shall grow like a cedar on Lebanon.
13 Those that are planted in the house of Jehovah shall flourish in the courts of our God:
14 They are still vigorous in old age, they are full of sap and green;
15 To shew that Jehovah is upright: [he is] my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
