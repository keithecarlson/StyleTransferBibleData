1 Jehovah answer thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob protect thee;
2 May he send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;
3 Remember all thine oblations, and accept thy burnt-offering; Selah.
4 Grant thee according to thy heart, and fulfil all thy counsels.
5 We will triumph in thy salvation, and in the name of our God will we set up our banners. Jehovah fulfil all thy petitions!
6 Now know I that Jehovah saveth his anointed; he answereth him from the heavens of his holiness, with the saving strength of his right hand.
7 Some make mention of chariots, and some of horses, but we of the name of Jehovah our God.
8 They are bowed down and fallen; but we are risen and stand upright.
9 Save, Jehovah! Let the king answer us in the day we call.
