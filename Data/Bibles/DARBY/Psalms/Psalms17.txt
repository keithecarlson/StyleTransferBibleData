1 Hear the right, O Jehovah, attend unto my cry; give ear unto my prayer, which is not out of feigned lips.
2 Let my judgment come forth from thy presence, let thine eyes regard equity.
3 Thou hast proved my heart, thou hast visited me by night; thou hast tried me, thou hast found nothing: my thought goeth not beyond my word.
4 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept from the paths of the violent .
5 When thou holdest my goings in thy paths, my footsteps slip not.
6 I have called upon thee, for thou answerest me, O God. Incline thine ear unto me, hear my speech.
7 Shew wondrously thy loving-kindnesses, O thou that savest by thy right hand them that trust [in thee] from those that rise up [against them].
8 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,
9 From the wicked that destroy me, my deadly enemies, who compass me about.
10 They are enclosed in their own fat; with their mouth they speak proudly.
11 They have now encompassed us in our steps; their eyes have they set, bowing down to the earth.
12 He is like a lion that is greedy of its prey, and as a young lion lurking in secret places.
13 Arise, Jehovah, anticipate him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, thy sword;
14 From men [who are] thy hand, O Jehovah, from men of this age: their portion is in  life, and their belly thou fillest with thy hid ; they have their fill of sons, and leave the rest of their  to their children.
15 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
