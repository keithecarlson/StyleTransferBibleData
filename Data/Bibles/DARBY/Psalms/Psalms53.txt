1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God! They have corrupted themselves, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.
2 God looked down from the heavens upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.
3 Every one of them is gone back, they are together become corrupt: there is none that doeth good, not even one.
4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, eating up my people  they eat bread? they call not upon God.
5 There were they in great fear, where no fear was; for God scattereth the bones of him that encampeth against thee. Thou hast put  to shame, for God hath despised them.
6 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God turneth again the captivity of his people, Jacob shall be glad, Israel shall rejoice.
