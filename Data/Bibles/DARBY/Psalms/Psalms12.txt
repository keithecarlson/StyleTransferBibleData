1 Save, Jehovah, for the godly man is gone; for the faithful have failed from among the children of men.
2 They speak falsehood every one with his neighbour:  flattering lip, with a double heart, do they speak.
3 Jehovah will cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaketh proud things,
4 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail, our lips are our own: who  lord over us?
5 Because of the oppression of the afflicted, because of the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith Jehovah, I will set  in safety, at whom they puff.
6 The words of Jehovah are pure words, silver tried in the furnace of earth, purified seven times.
7 Thou, Jehovah, wilt keep them, thou wilt preserve them from this generation for ever.
8 The wicked walk about on every side, when vileness is exalted among the children of men.
