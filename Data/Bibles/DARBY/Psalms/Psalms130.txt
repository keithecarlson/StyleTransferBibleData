1 Out of the depths do I call upon thee, Jehovah.
2 Lord, hear my voice; let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication.
3 If thou, Jah, shouldest mark iniquities, Lord, who shall stand?
4 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
5 I wait for Jehovah; my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.
6 My soul  for the Lord more than the watchers  for the morning, [more than] the watchers for the morning.
7 Let Israel hope in Jehovah, because with Jehovah there is loving-kindness, and with him is plenteous redemption;
8 And he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
