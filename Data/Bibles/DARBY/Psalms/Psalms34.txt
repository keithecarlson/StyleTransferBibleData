1 I will bless Jehovah at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth.
2 My soul shall make its boast in Jehovah: the meek shall hear, and rejoice.
3 Magnify Jehovah with me, and let us exalt his name together.
4 I sought Jehovah, and he answered me, and delivered me from all my fears.
5 They looked unto him, and were enlightened, and their faces were not confounded.
6 This afflicted one called, and Jehovah heard , and saved him out of all his troubles.
7 The angel of Jehovah encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.
8 Taste and see that Jehovah is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him!
9 Fear Jehovah, ye his saints; for there is no want to them that fear him.
10 The young lions are in need and suffer hunger; but they that seek Jehovah shall not want any good.
11 Come, ye sons, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of Jehovah.
12 What man is he that desireth life,  loveth days, that he may see good?
13 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile;
14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
15 The eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous, and his ears are toward their cry;
16 The face of Jehovah is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth:
17 [The righteous] cry, and Jehovah heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.
18 Jehovah is nigh to those that are of a broken heart, and saveth them that are of a contrite spirit.
19 Many are the adversities of the righteous, but Jehovah delivereth him out of them all:
20 He keepeth all his bones; not one of them is broken.
21 Evil shall destroy the wicked; and they that hate the righteous shall bear their guilt.
22 Jehovah redeemeth the soul of his servants; and none of them that trust in him shall bear guilt.
