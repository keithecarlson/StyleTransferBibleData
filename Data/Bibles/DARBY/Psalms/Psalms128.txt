1 Blessed is every one that feareth Jehovah, that walketh in his ways.
2 For thou shalt eat the labour of thy hands; happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
3 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine in the inner part of thy house; thy children like olive-plants round about thy table.
4 Behold, thus shall the man be blessed that feareth Jehovah.
5 Jehovah will bless thee out of Zion; and mayest thou see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life,
6 And see thy children's children. Peace be upon Israel!
