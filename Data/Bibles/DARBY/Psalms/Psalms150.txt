1 Hallelujah! Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in the firmament of his power.
2 Praise him in his mighty acts; praise him according to the abundance of his greatness.
3 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet; praise him with lute and harp;
4 Praise him with the tambour and dance; praise him with stringed instruments and the pipe;
5 Praise him with loud cymbals; praise him with high sounding cymbals.
6 Let everything that hath breath praise Jah. Hallelujah!
