1 Incline thine ear, Jehovah, answer me; for I am afflicted and needy.
2 Keep my soul, for I am godly; O thou my God, save thy servant who confideth in thee.
3 Be gracious unto me, O Lord; for unto thee do I call all the day.
4 Rejoice the soul of thy servant; for unto thee, Lord, do I lift up my soul.
5 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive, and art of great loving-kindness unto all that call upon thee.
6 Give ear, O Jehovah, unto my prayer, and attend to the voice of my supplications.
7 In the day of my distress I will call upon thee, for thou wilt answer me.
8 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, Lord, and there is nothing like unto thy works.
9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord, and shall glorify thy name.
10 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God, thou alone.
11 Teach me thy way, Jehovah; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.
12 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart; and I will glorify thy name for evermore.
13 For great is thy loving-kindness toward me, and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.
14 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assembly of the violent seek after my soul, and they have not set thee before them.
15 But thou, Lord, art a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in goodness and truth.
16 Turn toward me, and be gracious unto me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.
17 Shew me a token for good, that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed; for thou, Jehovah, hast helped me and comforted me.
