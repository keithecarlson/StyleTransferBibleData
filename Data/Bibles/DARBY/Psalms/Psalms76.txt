1 In Judah is God known, his name is great in Israel;
2 And in Salem is his tent, and his dwelling-place in Zion.
3 There broke he the flashings of the bow, shield and sword and battle. Selah.
4 More glorious art thou, more excellent, than the mountains of prey.
5 The stout-hearted are made a spoil, they have slept their sleep; and none of the men of might have found their hands.
6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.
7 Thou, thou art to be feared, and who can stand before thee when once thou art angry?
8 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from the heavens; the earth feared, and was still,
9 When God rose up to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.
10 For the fury of man shall praise thee; the remainder of fury wilt thou gird on thyself.
11 Vow and pay unto Jehovah your God: let all that are round about him bring presents unto him that is to be feared.
12 He cutteth off the spirit of princes;  is terrible to the kings of the earth.
