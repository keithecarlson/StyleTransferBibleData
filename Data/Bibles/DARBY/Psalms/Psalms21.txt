1 The king shall joy in thy strength, Jehovah; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice.
2 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.
3 For thou hast met him with the blessings of goodness; thou hast set a crown of pure gold on his head.
4 He asked life of thee; thou gavest  him, length of days for ever and ever.
5 His glory is great through thy salvation; majesty and splendour hast thou laid upon him.
6 For thou hast made him to be blessings for ever; thou hast filled him with joy by thy countenance.
7 For the king confideth in Jehovah: and through the loving-kindness of the Most High he shall not be moved.
8 Thy hand shall find out all thine enemies; thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.
9 Thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thy presence; Jehovah shall swallow them up in his anger, and the fire shall devour them:
10 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.
11 For they intended evil against thee; they imagined a mischievous device, which they could not execute.
12 For thou wilt make them turn their back; thou wilt make ready thy bowstring against their face.
13 Be thou exalted, Jehovah, in thine own strength: we will sing and celebrate thy power.
