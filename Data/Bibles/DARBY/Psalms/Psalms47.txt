1 All ye peoples, clap your hands; shout unto God with the voice of triumph!
2 For Jehovah, the Most High, is terrible, a great king over all the earth.
3 He subdueth the peoples under us, and the nations under our feet.
4 He hath chosen our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.
5 God is gone up amid shouting, Jehovah amid the sound of the trumpet.
6 Sing psalms of God, sing psalms; sing psalms unto our King, sing psalms!
7 For God is the King of all the earth; sing psalms with understanding.
8 God reigneth over the nations; God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.
9 The willing-hearted of the peoples have gathered together,  the people of the God of Abraham. For unto God  the shields of the earth: he is greatly exalted.
