1 Why boastest thou thyself in evil, thou mighty man? The loving-kindness of God  continually.
2 Thy tongue deviseth mischievous things, like a sharp razor, practising deceit.
3 Thou hast loved evil rather than good, lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.
4 Thou hast loved all devouring words, O deceitful tongue!
5 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever; he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of  tent, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.
6 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him, [saying,]
7 Behold the man that made not God his strength, but put confidence in the abundance of his riches,  strengthened himself in his avarice.
8 But as for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God: I will confide in the loving-kindness of God for ever and ever.
9 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done ; and I will wait on thy name, before thy godly ones, for it is good.
