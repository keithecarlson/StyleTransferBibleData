1 Hear, O God, my voice in my plaint; preserve my life from fear of the enemy:
2 Hide me from the secret counsel of evil-doers, from the tumultuous crowd of the workers of iniquity,
3 Who have sharpened their tongue like a sword,  have aimed their arrow, a bitter word;
4 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
5 They encourage themselves in an evil matter, they concert to hide snares; they say, Who will see them?
6 They devise iniquities: We have it ready, the plan is diligently sought out. And each one's inward  and heart is deep.
7 But God will shoot an arrow at them: suddenly are they wounded;
8 By their own tongue they are made to fall over one another: all that see them shall flee away.
9 And all men shall fear, and shall declare God's doing; and they shall wisely consider his work.
10 The righteous shall rejoice in Jehovah, and trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.
