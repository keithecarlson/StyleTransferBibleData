1 Unto thee, Jehovah, do I lift up my soul.
2 My God, I confide in thee; let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.
3 Yea, none that wait on thee shall be ashamed: they shall be ashamed that deal treacherously without cause.
4 Make me to know thy ways, O Jehovah; teach me thy paths.
5 Make me to walk in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.
6 Remember, Jehovah, thy tender mercies and thy loving-kindnesses; for they are from everlasting.
7 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions; according to thy loving-kindness remember thou me, for thy goodness' sake, Jehovah.
8 Good and upright is Jehovah; therefore will he instruct sinners in the way:
9 The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way.
10 All the paths of Jehovah are loving-kindness and truth for such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
11 For thy name's sake, O Jehovah, thou wilt indeed pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.
12 What man is he that feareth Jehovah? him will he instruct in the way  he should choose.
13 His soul shall dwell in prosperity, and his seed shall inherit the earth.
14 The secret of Jehovah is with them that fear him, that he may make known his covenant to them.
15 Mine eyes are ever toward Jehovah; for he will bring my feet out of the net.
16 Turn toward me, and be gracious unto me; for I am solitary and afflicted.
17 The troubles of my heart are increased: bring me out of my distresses;
18 Consider mine affliction and my travail, and forgive all my sins.
19 Consider mine enemies, for they are many, and they hate me  cruel hatred.
20 Keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I trust in thee.
21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.
22 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
