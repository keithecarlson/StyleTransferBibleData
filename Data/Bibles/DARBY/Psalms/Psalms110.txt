1 Jehovah said unto my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I put thine enemies  footstool of thy feet.
2 Jehovah shall send the sceptre of thy might out of Zion: rule in the midst of thine enemies.
3 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in holy splendour: from the womb of the morning [shall come] to thee the dew of thy youth.
4 Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek.
5 The Lord at thy right hand will smite through kings in the day of his anger.
6 He shall judge among the nations; he shall fill [all places] with dead bodies; he shall smite through the head over a great country.
7 He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore shall he lift up the head.
