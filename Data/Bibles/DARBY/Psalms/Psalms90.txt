1 Lord, *thou* hast been our dwelling-place in all generations.
2 Before the mountains were brought forth, and thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from eternity to eternity thou art God.
3 Thou makest  man to return to dust, and sayest, Return, children of men.
4 For a thousand years, in thy sight, are as yesterday when it is past, and  a watch in the night.
5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are  a sleep: in the morning they are like grass  groweth up:
6 In the morning it flourisheth and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down and withereth.
7 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy fury are we troubled.
8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret  in the light of thy countenance.
9 For all our days pass away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a  thought.
10 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if, by reason of strength, they be fourscore years, yet their pride is labour and vanity, for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
11 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? and thy wrath according to the fear of thee?
12 So teach  to number our days, that we may acquire a wise heart.
13 Return, Jehovah: how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.
14 Satisfy us early with thy loving-kindness; that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.
15 Make us glad according to the days  thou hast afflicted us, according to the years  we have seen evil.
16 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy majesty unto their sons.
17 And let the beauty of Jehovah our God be upon us; and establish thou the work of our hands upon us: yea, the work of our hands, establish thou it.
