1 Jehovah reigneth: let the peoples tremble. He sitteth [between the] cherubim: let the earth be moved.
2 Jehovah is great in Zion, and he is high above all the peoples.
3 They shall praise thy great and terrible name,—it is holy!—
4 And the strength of the king that loveth justice. *Thou* hast established equity: it is thou that executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
5 Exalt Jehovah our God, and worship at his footstool. He is holy!
6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name: they called unto Jehovah, and *he* answered them.
7 He spoke unto them in the pillar of cloud: they kept his testimonies, and the statute that he gave them.
8 Jehovah, our God, *thou* answeredst them: a forgiving God wast thou unto them, though thou tookest vengeance of their doings.
9 Exalt Jehovah our God, and worship at the hill of his holiness; for holy is Jehovah our God.
