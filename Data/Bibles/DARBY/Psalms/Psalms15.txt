1 Jehovah, who shall sojourn in thy tent? who shall dwell in the hill of thy holiness?
2 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth from his heart.
3 [He that] slandereth not with his tongue, doeth not evil to his companion, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour;
4 In whose eyes the depraved person is contemned, and who honoureth them that fear Jehovah; who, if he have sworn to his own hurt, changeth it not;
5 [He that] putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these  shall never be moved.
