1 The transgression of the wicked uttereth within my heart, There is no fear of God before his eyes.
2 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes,  when his iniquity is found to be hateful.
3 The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, to do good.
4 He deviseth wickedness up on his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good: he abhorreth not evil.
5 Jehovah, thy loving-kindness is in the heavens, and thy faithfulness  unto the clouds.
6 Thy righteousness is like the high mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: thou, Jehovah, preservest man and beast.
7 How precious is thy loving-kindness, O God! So the sons of men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings.
8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou wilt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
9 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.
10 Continue thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee, and thy righteousness to the upright in heart;
11 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.
12 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and are not able to rise.
