1 I will extol thee, my God, O King, and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.
2 Every day will I bless thee, and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.
3 Great is Jehovah, and exceedingly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable.
4 One generation shall laud thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.
5 I will speak of the glorious splendour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works.
6 And they shall tell of the might of thy terrible acts; and thy great deeds will I declare.
7 They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
8 Jehovah is gracious and merciful; slow to anger, and of great loving-kindness.
9 Jehovah is good to all; and his tender mercies are over all his works.
10 All thy works shall praise thee, Jehovah, and thy saints shall bless thee.
11 They shall tell of the glory of thy kingdom, and speak of thy power;
12 To make known to the children of men his mighty acts, and the glorious splendour of his kingdom.
13 Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages, and thy dominion is throughout all generations.
14 Jehovah upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all that are bowed down.
15 The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their food in its season.
16 Thou openest thy hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.
17 Jehovah is righteous in all his ways, and kind in all his works.
18 Jehovah is nigh unto all that call upon him, unto all that call upon him in truth.
19 He fulfilleth the desire of them that fear him; he heareth their cry, and saveth them.
20 Jehovah keepeth all that love him, and all the wicked will he destroy.
21 My mouth shall speak the praise of Jehovah; and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
