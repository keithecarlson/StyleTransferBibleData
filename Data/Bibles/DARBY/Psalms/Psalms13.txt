1 How long, Jehovah, wilt thou forget me for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, with sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
3 Consider, answer me, O Jehovah my God! lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the [sleep of] death;
4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him!  mine adversaries be joyful when I am moved.
5 As for me, I have confided in thy loving-kindness; my heart shall be joyful in thy salvation.
6 I will sing unto Jehovah, for he hath dealt bountifully with me.
