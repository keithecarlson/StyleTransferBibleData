1 God standeth in the assembly of God, he judgeth among the gods.
2 How long will ye judge unrighteously, and accept the person of the wicked? Selah.
3 Judge the poor and the fatherless, do justice to the afflicted and the destitute;
4 Rescue the poor and needy, deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.
5 They know not, neither do they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are moved.
6 I have said, Ye are gods, and all of you are children of the Most High;
7 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
8 Arise, O God, judge the earth; for *thou* shalt inherit all the nations.
