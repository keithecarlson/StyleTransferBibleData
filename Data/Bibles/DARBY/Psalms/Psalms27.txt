1 Jehovah is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? Jehovah is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
2 When evil-doers, mine adversaries and mine enemies, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
3 If a host encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; if war rise against me, in this will I be confident.
4 One  have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of Jehovah, and to inquire [of him] in his temple.
5 For in the day of evil he will hide me in his pavilion; in the secret of his tent will he keep me concealed: he will set me high upon a rock.
6 And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me; and I will offer in his tent sacrifices of shouts of joy: I will sing, yea, I will sing psalms unto Jehovah.
7 Hear, Jehovah; with my voice do I call; be gracious unto me, and answer me.
8 My heart said for thee, Seek ye my face. Thy face, O Jehovah, will I seek.
9 Hide not thy face from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.
10 For had my father and my mother forsaken me, then had Jehovah taken me up.
11 Teach me thy way, Jehovah, and lead me in an even path, because of mine enemies.
12 Deliver me not over to the will of mine adversaries; for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out violence.
13 Unless I had believed to see the goodness of Jehovah in the land of the living …!
14 Wait for Jehovah; be strong and let thy heart take courage: yea, wait for Jehovah.
