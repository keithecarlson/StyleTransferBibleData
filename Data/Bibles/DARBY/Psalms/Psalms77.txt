1 My voice is unto God, and I will cry; my voice is unto God, and he will give ear unto me.
2 In the day of my trouble, I sought the Lord: my hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not; my soul refused to be comforted.
3 I remembered God, and I moaned; I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.
4 Thou holdest open mine eyelids; I am full of disquiet and cannot speak.
5 I consider the days of old, the years of ancient times.
6 I remember my song in the night; I muse in mine own heart, and my spirit maketh diligent search.
7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?
8 Hath his loving-kindness ceased for ever? hath  word come to an end from generation to generation?
9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? or hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
10 Then said I, This is my weakness:—the years of the right hand of the Most High
11 Will I remember,—the works of Jah; for I will remember thy wonders of old,
12 And I will meditate upon all thy work, and muse upon thy doings.
13 O God, thy way is in the sanctuary: who is so great a god as God?
14 Thou art the God that doest wonders; thou hast declared thy strength among the peoples.
15 Thou hast with  arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they trembled, yea, the depths were troubled:
17 The thick clouds poured out water; the skies sent out a sound, yea, thine arrows went abroad:
18 The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind, lightnings lit up the world; the earth was troubled and it quaked.
19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths are in the great waters; and thy footsteps are not known.
20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
