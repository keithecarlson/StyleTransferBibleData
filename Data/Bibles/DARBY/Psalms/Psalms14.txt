2 Jehovah looked down from the heavens upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.
3 They have all gone aside, they are together become corrupt: there is none that doeth good, not even one.
4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, eating up my people  they eat bread? They call not upon Jehovah.
5 There were they in great fear; for God is in the generation of the righteous.
6 Ye have shamed the counsel of the afflicted, because Jehovah  his refuge.
7 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When Jehovah turneth again the captivity of his people, Jacob shall be glad, Israel shall rejoice.
