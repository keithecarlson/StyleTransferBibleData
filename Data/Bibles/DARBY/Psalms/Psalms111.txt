1 Hallelujah! I will celebrate Jehovah with  whole heart, in the council of the upright, and in the assembly.
2 Great are the works of Jehovah; sought out of all that delight in them.
3 His work is majesty and splendour, and his righteousness abideth for ever.
4 He hath made his wonders to be remembered: Jehovah is gracious and merciful.
5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him; he is ever mindful of his covenant.
6 He hath shewn his people the power of his works, to give them the heritage of the nations.
7 The works of his hands are truth and judgment; all his precepts are faithful:
8 Maintained for ever and ever, done in truth and uprightness.
9 He sent deliverance unto his people; he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and terrible is his name.
10 The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all they that do [his precepts]: his praise abideth for ever.
