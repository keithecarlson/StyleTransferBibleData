1 Hallelujah! Sing unto Jehovah a new song;  his praise in the congregation of the godly.
2 Let Israel rejoice in his Maker; let the sons of Zion be joyful in their King.
3 Let them praise his name in the dance; let them sing psalms unto him with the tambour and harp.
4 For Jehovah taketh pleasure in his people; he beautifieth the meek with salvation.
5 Let the godly exult in glory; let them shout for joy upon their beds.
6 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand:
7 To execute vengeance against the nations,  punishment among the peoples;
8 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;
9 To execute upon them the judgment written. This honour have all his saints. Hallelujah!
