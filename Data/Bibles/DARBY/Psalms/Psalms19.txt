1 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the expanse sheweth the work of his hands.
2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.
3 There is no speech and there are no words, yet their voice is heard.
4 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their language to the extremity of the world. In them hath he set a tent for the sun,
5 And he is as a bridegroom going forth from his chamber; he rejoiceth as a strong man to run the race.
6 His going forth is from the end of the heavens, and his circuit unto the ends of it; and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
7 The law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the simple;
8 The precepts of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of Jehovah is pure, enlightening the eyes;
9 The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring for ever; the judgments of Jehovah are truth, they are righteous altogether:
10 They are more precious than gold, yea, than much fine gold; and sweeter than honey and the dropping of the honeycomb.
11 Moreover, by them is thy servant enlightened; in keeping them there is great reward.
12 Who understandeth  errors? Purify me from secret .
13 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous ; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be perfect, and I shall be innocent from great transgression.
14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Jehovah, my rock, and my redeemer.
