1 O God, keep not silence; hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God:
2 For behold, thine enemies make a tumult; and they that hate thee lift up the head.
3 They take crafty counsel against thy people, and consult against thy hidden ones:
4 They say, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation, and let the name of Israel be mentioned no more.
5 For they have consulted together with one heart: they have made an alliance together against thee.
6 The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagarites;
7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia, with the inhabitants of Tyre;
8 Asshur also is joined with them: they are an arm to the sons of Lot. Selah.
9 Do unto them as to Midian; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the torrent of Kishon:
10 Who were destroyed at Endor; they became as dung for the ground.
11 Make their nobles as Oreb and as Zeeb; and all their chiefs as Zebah and as Zalmunna.
12 For they have said, Let us take to ourselves God's dwelling-places in possession.
13 O my God, make them like a whirling thing, like stubble before the wind.
14 As fire burneth a forest, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire,
15 So pursue them with thy tempest, and terrify them with thy whirlwind.
16 Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek thy name, O Jehovah.
17 Let them be put to shame and be dismayed for ever, and let them be confounded and perish:
18 That they may know that thou alone, whose name is Jehovah, art the Most High over all the earth.
