1 I will sing of loving-kindness and judgment: unto thee, Jehovah, will I sing psalms.
2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. When wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house in the integrity of my heart.
3 I will set no thing of Belial before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.
4 A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will not know evil.
5 Whoso secretly slandereth his neighbour, him will I destroy; him that hath a high look and a proud heart will I not suffer.
6 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.
7 He that practiseth deceit shall not dwell within my house; he that speaketh falsehoods shall not subsist in my sight.
8 Every morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land: to cut off all workers of iniquity from the city of Jehovah.
