1 Jehovah my God, in thee have I trusted: save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me;
2 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, crushing it while there is no deliverer.
3 Jehovah my God, if I have done this, if there be iniquity in my hands;
4 If I have rewarded evil to him that was at peace with me; (indeed I have freed him that without cause oppressed me;)
5 Let the enemy pursue after my soul, and take , and let him tread down my life to the earth, and lay my glory in the dust. Selah.
6 Arise, Jehovah, in thine anger; lift thyself up against the raging of mine oppressors, and awake for me: thou hast commanded judgment.
7 And the assembly of the peoples shall encompass thee; and for their sakes return thou on high.
8 Jehovah shall minister judgment to the peoples. Judge me, Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity which is in me.
9 Oh let the wrong of the wicked come to an end, and establish thou the righteous ; even thou that triest the hearts and reins, the righteous God.
10 My shield is with God, who saveth the upright in heart.
11 God is a righteous judge, and a God who is indignant all the day.
12 If one turn not, he will sharpen his sword; he hath bent his bow and made it ready,
13 And he hath prepared for him instruments of death; his arrows hath he made burning.
14 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, yea, he hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood:
15 He digged a pit, and hollowed it out, and is fallen into the hole that he made.
16 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violence shall come down upon his own pate.
17 I will praise Jehovah according to his righteousness, and will sing forth the name of Jehovah the Most High.
