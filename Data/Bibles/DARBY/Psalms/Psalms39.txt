1 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a muzzle, while the wicked is before me.
2 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace from good; and my sorrow was stirred.
3 My heart burned within me; the fire was kindled in my musing: I spoke with my tongue,
4 Make me to know, Jehovah, mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: I shall know how frail I am.
5 Behold, thou hast made my days  hand-breadths, and my lifetime is as nothing before thee; verily, every man,  the high placed, is altogether vanity. Selah.
6 Verily, man walketh in a vain show; verily they are disquieted in vain; he heapeth up , and knoweth not who shall gather them.
7 And now, what wait I for, Lord? my hope is in thee.
8 Deliver me from all my transgressions; make me not the reproach of the foolish.
9 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; for *thou* hast done .
10 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thy hand.
11 When thou with rebukes dost correct a man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely, every man is vanity. Selah.
12 Hear my prayer, Jehovah, and give ear unto my cry; be not silent at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, a sojourner, like all my fathers.
13 Look away from me, and let me recover strength, before I go hence and be no more.
