1 God is our refuge and strength, a help in distresses, very readily found.
2 Therefore will we not fear though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the heart of the seas;
3 Though the waters thereof roar  foam, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.
4 There is a river the streams whereof make glad the city of God, the sanctuary of the habitations of the Most High.
5 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her at the dawn of the morning.
6 The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved; he uttered his voice, the earth melted.
7 Jehovah of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our high fortress. Selah.
8 Come, behold the works of Jehovah, what desolations he hath made in the earth:
9 He hath made wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariots in the fire.
10 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.
11 Jehovah of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our high fortress. Selah.
