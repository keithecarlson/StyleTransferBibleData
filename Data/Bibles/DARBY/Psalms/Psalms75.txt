1 Unto thee we give thanks, O God, we give thanks; and thy name is near: thy marvellous works declare it.
2 When I shall receive the assembly, I will judge with equity.
3 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I have established its pillars. Selah.
4 I said unto the boastful, Boast not; and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:
5 Lift not up your horn on high; speak not arrogantly with a  neck.
6 For not from the east nor from the west, nor yet from the south doth exaltation :
7 For God is the judge; he putteth down one and exalteth another.
8 For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and it foameth with wine, it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same; yea, the dregs thereof shall all the wicked of the earth drain off,  drink.
9 But as for me, I will declare for ever; I will sing psalms to the God of Jacob.
10 And all the horns of the wicked will I cut off;  the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
