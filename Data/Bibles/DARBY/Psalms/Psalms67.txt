1 God be gracious unto us, and bless us,  cause his face to shine upon us; Selah,
2 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy salvation among all nations.
3 Let the peoples praise thee, O God, let all the peoples praise thee.
4 Let the nations rejoice and sing for joy: for thou wilt judge the peoples equitably; and the nations upon earth, thou wilt guide them. Selah.
5 Let the peoples praise thee, O God; let all the peoples praise thee.
6 The earth will yield her increase; God, our God, will bless us:
7 God will bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
