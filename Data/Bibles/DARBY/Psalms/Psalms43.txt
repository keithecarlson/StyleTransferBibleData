1 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation; deliver me from the deceitful and unrighteous man.
2 For thou art the God of my strength: why hast thou cast me off? why go I about mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
3 Send out thy light and thy truth: *they* shall lead me, *they* shall bring me to thy holy mount, and unto thy habitations.
4 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto the God of the gladness of my joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God, my God.
5 Why art thou cast down, my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God; for I shall yet praise him, [who is] the health of my countenance, and my God.
