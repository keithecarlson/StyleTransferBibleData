1 My heart is welling forth  a good matter: I say what I have composed touching the king. My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
2 Thou art fairer than the sons of men; grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
3 Gird thy sword upon  thigh, O mighty one,  thy majesty and thy splendour;
4 And  thy splendour ride prosperously, because of truth and meekness  righteousness: and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
5 Thine arrows are sharp—peoples fall under thee—in the heart of the king's enemies.
6 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of thy kingdom:
7 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy companions.
8 Myrrh and aloes, cassia, are all thy garments; out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad.
9 Kings' daughters are among thine honourable women; upon thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
10 Hearken, daughter, and see, and incline thine ear; and forget thine own people and thy father's house:
11 And the king will desire thy beauty; for he is thy Lord, and worship thou him.
12 And the daughter of Tyre with a gift, the rich ones among the people, shall court thy favour.
13 All glorious is the king's daughter within; her clothing is of wrought gold:
14 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of embroidery; the virgins behind her, her companions, shall be brought in unto thee:
15 With joy and gladness shall they be brought; they shall enter into the king's palace.
16 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy sons; princes shalt thou make them in all the earth.
17 I will make thy name to be remembered throughout all generations; therefore shall the peoples praise thee for ever and ever.
