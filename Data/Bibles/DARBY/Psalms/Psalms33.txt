1 Exult, ye righteous, in Jehovah: praise is comely for the upright.
2 Give thanks unto Jehovah with the harp; sing psalms unto him with the ten-stringed lute.
3 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud sound.
4 For the word of Jehovah is right, and all his work is in faithfulness.
5 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the loving-kindness of Jehovah.
6 By the word of Jehovah were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap; he layeth up the deeps in storehouses.
8 Let all the earth fear Jehovah; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
9 For *he* spoke, and it was ; *he* commanded, and it stood fast.
10 Jehovah frustrateth the counsel of the nations; he maketh the thoughts of the peoples of none effect.
11 The counsel of Jehovah standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart from generation to generation.
12 Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people that he hath chosen for his inheritance!
13 Jehovah looketh from the heavens; he beholdeth all the sons of men:
14 From the place of his habitation he looketh forth upon all the inhabitants of the earth;
15 He who fashioneth the hearts of them all, who considereth all their works.
16 The king is not saved by the multitude of  forces; a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.
17 The horse is a vain thing for safety; neither doth he deliver by his great power.
18 Behold, the eye of Jehovah is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his loving-kindness,
19 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.
20 Our soul waiteth for Jehovah: he is our help and our shield.
21 For in him shall our heart rejoice, because we have confided in his holy name.
22 Let thy loving-kindness, O Jehovah, be upon us, according as we have hoped in thee.
