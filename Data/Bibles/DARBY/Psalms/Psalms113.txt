1 Hallelujah! Praise, ye servants of Jehovah, praise the name of Jehovah.
2 Blessed be the name of Jehovah, from this time forth and for evermore!
3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, let Jehovah's name be praised.
4 Jehovah is high above all nations, his glory above the heavens.
5 Who is like unto Jehovah our God, who hath placed his dwelling on high;
6 Who humbleth himself to look on the heavens and on the earth?
7 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust; from the dung-hill he lifteth up the needy,
8 To set  among nobles, among the nobles of his people.
9 He maketh the barren woman to keep house,  a joyful mother of sons. Hallelujah!
