1 I will extol thee, Jehovah; for thou hast delivered me, and hast not made mine enemies to rejoice over me.
2 Jehovah my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
3 Jehovah, thou hast brought up my soul from Sheol, thou hast quickened me from among those that go down to the pit.
4 Sing psalms unto Jehovah, ye saints of his, and give thanks in remembrance of his holiness.
5 For a moment [is passed] in his anger, a life in his favour; at even weeping cometh for the night, and at morn there is rejoicing.
6 As for me, I said in my prosperity, I shall never be moved.
7 Jehovah, by thy favour thou hadst made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face; I was troubled.
8 I called to thee, Jehovah, and unto the Lord did I make supplication:
9 What profit is there in my blood, in my going down to the pit? shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?
10 Hear, O Jehovah, and be gracious unto me; Jehovah, be my helper.
11 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing; thou hast loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;
12 That  glory may sing psalms of thee, and not be silent. Jehovah my God, I will praise thee for ever.
