1 Bless Jehovah, O my soul; and all that is within me,  his holy name!
2 Bless Jehovah, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy diseases;
4 Who redeemeth thy life from the pit, who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies;
5 Who satisfieth thine old age with good ; thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.
6 Jehovah executeth righteousness and justice for all that are oppressed.
7 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.
8 Jehovah is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in loving-kindness.
9 He will not always chide, neither will he keep [his anger] for ever.
10 He hath not dealt with us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
11 For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is his loving-kindness toward them that fear him.
12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
13 As a father pitieth  children, so Jehovah pitieth them that fear him.
14 For himself knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
15 As for man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth:
16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone, and the place thereof knoweth it no more.
17 But the loving-kindness of Jehovah is from everlasting and to everlasting, upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children,
18 To such as keep his covenant and to those that remember his precepts to do them.
19 Jehovah hath established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom ruleth over all.
20 Bless Jehovah, ye his angels, mighty in strength, that execute his word, hearkening unto the voice of his word.
21 Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his that do his will.
22 Bless Jehovah, all his works, in all places of his dominion. Bless Jehovah, O my soul!
