1 Hallelujah! Praise Jehovah, O my soul.
2 As long as I live will I praise Jehovah; I will sing psalms unto my God while I have my being.
3 Put not confidence in nobles, in a son of man, in whom there is no salvation.
4 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his purposes perish.
5 Blessed is he who hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in Jehovah his God,
6 Who made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is therein; who keepeth truth for ever;
7 Who executeth judgment for the oppressed, who giveth bread to the hungry. Jehovah looseth the prisoners;
8 Jehovah openeth [the eyes of] the blind; Jehovah raiseth up them that are bowed down; Jehovah loveth the righteous;
9 Jehovah preserveth the strangers; he lifteth up the fatherless and the widow; but the way of the wicked doth he subvert.
10 Jehovah will reign for ever,  thy God, O Zion, from generation to generation. Halleluiah!
