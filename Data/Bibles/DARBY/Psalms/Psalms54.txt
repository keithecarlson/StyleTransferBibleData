1 O God, by thy name save me, and by thy strength do me justice.
2 O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth.
3 For strangers are risen up against me, and the violent seek after my life: they have not set God before them. Selah.
4 Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is among them that uphold my soul.
5 He will requite evil to mine enemies: in thy truth cut them off.
6 I will freely sacrifice unto thee; I will praise thy name, O Jehovah, because it is good.
7 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble; and mine eye hath seen [its desire] upon mine enemies.
