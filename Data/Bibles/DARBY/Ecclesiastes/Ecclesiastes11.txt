1 Cast thy bread upon the waters; for thou shalt find it after many days.
2 Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.
3 If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth; and if a tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.
4 He that observeth the wind will not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds will not reap.
5 As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, how the bones  in the womb of her that is with child, even so thou knowest not the work of God who maketh all.
6 In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.
7 Now the light is sweet, and pleasant is it to the eyes to see the sun;
8 but if a man live many years,  rejoice in them all, yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many: all that cometh is vanity.
9 Rejoice, young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know that for all these  God will bring thee into judgment.
10 Then remove discontent from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh; for childhood and youth are vanity.
