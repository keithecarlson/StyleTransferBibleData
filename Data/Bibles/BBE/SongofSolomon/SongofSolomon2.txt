1 I am a rose of Sharon, a flower of the valleys.
2 As the lily-flower among the thorns of the waste, so is my love among the daughters.
3 As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my loved one among the sons. I took my rest under his shade with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.
4 He took me to the house of wine, and his flag over me was love.
5 Make me strong with wine-cakes, let me be comforted with apples; I am overcome with love.
6 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand is round about me.
7 I say to you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes of the field, do not let love be moved till it is ready.
8 The voice of my loved one! See, he comes dancing on the mountains, stepping quickly on the hills.
9 My loved one is like a roe; see, he is on the other side of our wall, he is looking in at the windows, letting himself be seen through the spaces.
10 My loved one said to me, Get up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
11 For, see, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;
12 The flowers are come on the earth; the time of cutting the vines is come, and the voice of the dove is sounding in our land;
13 The fig-tree puts out her green fruit and the vines with their young fruit give a good smell. Get up from your bed, my beautiful one, and come away.
14 O my dove, you are in the holes of the mountain sides, in the cracks of the high hills; let me see your face, let your voice come to my ears; for sweet is your voice, and your face is fair.
15 Take for us the foxes, the little foxes, which do damage to the vines; our vines have young grapes.
16 My loved one is mine, and I am his: he takes his food among the flowers.
17 Till the evening comes, and the sky slowly becomes dark, come, my loved one, and be like a roe on the mountains of Bether.
