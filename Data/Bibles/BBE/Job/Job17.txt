1 My spirit is broken, my days are ended, the last resting-place is ready for me.
2 Truly, those who make sport of me are round about me, and my eyes become dark because of their bitter laughing.
3 Be pleased, now, to be responsible for me to yourself; for there is no other who will put his hand in mine.
4 You have kept their hearts from wisdom: for this cause you will not give them honour.
5 As for him who is false to his friend for a reward, light will be cut off from the eyes of his children.
6 He has made me a word of shame to the peoples; I have become a mark for their sport.
7 My eyes have become dark because of my pain, and all my body is wasted to a shade.
8 The upright are surprised at this, and he who has done no wrong is troubled because of the evil-doers.
9 Still the upright keeps on his way, and he who has clean hands gets new strength.
10 But come back, now, all of you, come; and I will not see a wise man among you.
11 My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the desires of my heart.
12 They are changing night into day; they say, The light is near the dark.
13 If I am waiting for the underworld as my house, if I have made my bed in the dark;
14 If I say to the earth, You are my father; and to the worm, My mother and my sister;
15 Where then is my hope? and who will see my desire?
16 Will they go down with me into the underworld? Will we go down together into the dust?
