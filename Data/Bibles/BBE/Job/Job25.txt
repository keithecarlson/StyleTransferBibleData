1 Then Bildad the Shuhite made answer and said,
2 Rule and power are his; he makes peace in his high places.
3 Is it possible for his armies to be numbered? and on whom is not his light shining?
4 How then is it possible for man to be upright before God? or how may he be clean who is a son of woman?
5 See, even the moon is not bright, and the stars are not clean in his eyes:
6 How much less man who is an insect, and the son of man who is a worm!
