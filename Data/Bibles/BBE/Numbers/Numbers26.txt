1 Now after the disease was over, the Lord said to Moses and Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
2 Let all the children of Israel be numbered, by the names of their fathers' families, all those of twenty years old and over who are able to go to war in Israel.
3 So Moses and Eleazar the priest gave them the order in the lowlands of Moab by Jordan at Jericho, saying,

54 To those families who are more in number, give a greater heritage; to those who are less in number, a smaller part: to every one let the heritage be given in relation to the number in his family.
