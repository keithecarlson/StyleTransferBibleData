1 Bel is bent down, Nebo is falling; their images are on the beasts and on the cattle: the things which you took about have become a weight to the tired beast.
2 They are bent down, they are falling together: they were not able to keep their images safe, but they themselves have been taken prisoner.
3 Give ear to me, O family of Jacob, and all the rest of the people of Israel, who have been supported by me from their birth, and have been my care from their earliest days:
4 Even when you are old I will be the same, and when you are grey-haired I will take care of you: I will still be responsible for what I made; yes, I will take you and keep you safe.
5 Who in your eyes is my equal? or what comparison will you make with me?
6 As for those who take gold out of a bag, and put silver in the scales, they give payment to a gold-worker, to make it into a god; they go down on their faces and give it worship.
7 They put him on their backs, and take him up, and put him in his fixed place, from which he may not be moved; if a man gives a cry for help to him, he is unable to give an answer, or get him out of his trouble.
8 Keep this in mind and be shamed; let it come back to your memory, you sinners.
9 Let the things which are past come to your memory: for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is no one like me;
10 Making clear from the first what is to come, and from past times the things which have not so far come about; saying, My purpose is fixed, and I will do all my pleasure;
11 Sending for a bird of strong flight from the east, the man of my purpose from a far country; I have said it, and I will give effect to it; the thing designed by me will certainly be done.
12 Give ear to me, you feeble-hearted, who have no faith in my righteousness:
13 My righteousness is near, it is not far off; salvation will come quickly; and I will make Zion free, and give Israel my glory.
