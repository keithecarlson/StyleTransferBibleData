1 &lt;To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; O God, let the voice of my grief come to your ear: keep my life from the fear of those who are against me.
2 Keep me safe from the secret purpose of wrongdoers; from the band of the workers of evil;
3 Who make their tongues sharp like a sword, and whose arrows are pointed, even bitter words;
4 So that in secret they may let loose their arrows at the upright, suddenly and unseen.
5 They make themselves strong in an evil purpose; they make holes for secret nets; they say, Who will see it,
6 Or make discovery of our secret purpose? The design is framed with care; and the inner thought of a man, and his heart, is deep.
7 But God sends out an arrow against them; suddenly they are wounded.
8 The evil of their tongues is the cause of their fall; all those who see them are shaking their heads at them.
9 And in fear men make public the works of God; and giving thought to his acts they get wisdom.
10 The upright will be glad in the Lord and have hope in him; and all the lovers of righteousness will give him glory.
