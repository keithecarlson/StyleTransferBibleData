1 Let the Lord be praised. Give praise to God in his holy place: give him praise in the heaven of his power.
2 Give him praise for his acts of power: give him praise in the measure of his great strength.
3 Give him praise with the sound of the horn: give him praise with corded instruments of music.
4 Give him praise with instruments of brass and in the dance: give him praise with horns and corded instruments.
5 Give him praise with the loud brass: give him praise with the high-sounding brass.
6 Let everything which has breath give praise to the Lord. Let the Lord be praised.
