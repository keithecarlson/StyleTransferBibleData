1 &lt;Michtam. Of David.&gt; Keep me safe, O God: for in you I have put my faith.
2 O my soul, you have said to the Lord, You are my Lord: I have no good but you.
3 As for the saints who are in the earth, they are the noble in whom is all my delight.
4 Their sorrows will be increased who go after another god: I will not take drink offerings from their hands, or take their names on my lips.
5 The Lord is my heritage and the wine of my cup; you are the supporter of my right.
6 Fair are the places marked out for me; I have a noble heritage.
7 I will give praise to the Lord who has been my guide; knowledge comes to me from my thoughts in the night.
8 I have put the Lord before me at all times; because he is at my right hand, I will not be moved.
9 Because of this my heart is glad, and my glory is full of joy: while my flesh takes its rest in hope.
10 For you will not let my soul be prisoned in the underworld; you will not let your loved one see the place of death.
11 You will make clear to me the way of life; where you are joy is complete; in your right hand there are pleasures for ever and ever.
