1 &lt;A Psalm. Of David.&gt; Give to the Lord, you sons of the gods, give to the Lord glory and strength.
2 Give to the Lord the full glory of his name; give him worship in holy robes.
3 The voice of the Lord is on the waters: the God of glory is thundering, the Lord is on the great waters.
4 The voice of the Lord is full of power; the voice of the Lord has a noble sound.
5 By the voice of the Lord are the cedar-trees broken, even the cedars of Lebanon are broken by the Lord.
6 He makes them go jumping about like a young ox; Lebanon and Sirion like a young mountain ox.
7 At the voice of the Lord flames of fire are seen.
8 At the voice of the Lord there is a shaking in the waste land, even a shaking in the waste land of Kadesh.
9 At the voice of the Lord the roes give birth, the leaves are taken from the trees: in his Temple everything says, Glory.
10 The Lord had his seat as king when the waters came on the earth; the Lord is seated as king for ever.
11 The Lord will give strength to his people; the Lord will give his people the blessing of peace.
