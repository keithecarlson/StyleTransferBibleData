1 &lt;A Psalm. Of David.&gt; Let my prayer come to you, O Lord; give ear to my requests for your grace; keep faith with me, and give me an answer in your righteousness;
2 Let not your servant come before you to be judged; for no man living is upright in your eyes.
3 The evil man has gone after my soul; my life is crushed down to the earth: he has put me in the dark, like those who have long been dead.
4 Because of this my spirit is overcome; and my heart is full of fear.
5 I keep in mind the early days of the past, giving thought to all your acts, even to the work of your hands.
6 My hands are stretched out to you: my soul is turned to you, like a land in need of water. (Selah.)
7 Be quick in answering me, O Lord, for the strength of my spirit is gone: let me see your face, so that I may not be like those who go down into the underworld.
8 Let the story of your mercy come to me in the morning, for my hope is in you: give me knowledge of the way in which I am to go; for my soul is lifted up to you.
9 O Lord, take me out of the hands of my haters; my soul is waiting for you.
10 Give me teaching so that I may do your pleasure; for you are my God: let your good Spirit be my guide into the land of righteousness.
11 Give me life, O Lord, because of your name; in your righteousness take my soul out of trouble.
12 And in your mercy put an end to my haters, and send destruction on all those who are against my soul; for I am your servant.
