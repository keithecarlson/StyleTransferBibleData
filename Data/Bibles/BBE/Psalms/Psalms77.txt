1 &lt;To the chief music-maker. After Jeduthun. Of Asaph. A Psalm.&gt; I was crying to God with my voice; even to God with my voice, and he gave ear to me.
2 In the day of my trouble, my heart was turned to the Lord: my hand was stretched out in the night without resting; my soul would not be comforted.
3 I will keep God in memory, with sounds of grief; my thoughts are troubled, and my spirit is overcome. (Selah.)
4 You keep my eyes from sleep; I am so troubled that no words come.
5 My thoughts go back to the days of the past, to the years which are gone.
6 The memory of my song comes back to me in the night; my thoughts are moving in my heart; my spirit is searching with care.
7 Will the Lord put me away for ever? will he be kind no longer?
8 Is his mercy quite gone for ever? has his word come to nothing?
9 Has God put away the memory of his pity? are his mercies shut up by his wrath? (Selah.)
10 And I said, It is a weight on my spirit; but I will keep in mind the years of the right hand of the Most High.
11 I will keep in mind the works of Jah: I will keep the memory of your wonders in the past.
12 I will give thought to all your work, while my mind goes over your acts of power.
13 Your way, O God, is holy: what god is so great as our God?
14 You are the God who does works of power: you have made your strength clear to the nations.
15 With your arm you have made your people free, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. (Selah.)
16 The waters saw you, O God; the waters saw you, they were in fear: even the deep was troubled.
17 The clouds sent out water; the skies gave out a sound; truly, your arrows went far and wide.
18 The voice of your thunder went rolling on; the world was flaming with the light of the storm; the earth was shaking.
19 Your way was in the sea, and your road in the great waters; there was no knowledge of your footsteps.
20 You were guiding your people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
