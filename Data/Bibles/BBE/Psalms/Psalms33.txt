1 Be glad in the Lord, O doers of righteousness; for praise is beautiful for the upright.
2 Give praise to the Lord on the corded instrument; make melody to him with instruments of music.
3 Make a new song to him; playing expertly with a loud noise.
4 For the word of the Lord is upright, and all his works are certain.
5 His delight is in righteousness and wisdom; the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord.
6 By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the army of heaven by the breath of his mouth.
7 He makes the waters of the sea come together in a mass; he keeps the deep seas in store-houses.
8 Let the earth be full of the fear of the Lord; let all the people of the world be in holy fear of him.
9 For he gave the word, and it was done; by his order it was fixed for ever.
10 The Lord undoes the designs of the nations; he makes the thoughts of the peoples without effect.
11 The Lord's purpose is eternal, the designs of his heart go on through all the generations of man.
12 Happy is the nation whose God is the Lord; and the people whom he has taken for his heritage.
13 The Lord is looking down from heaven; he sees all the sons of men;
14 From his house he keeps watch on all who are living on the earth;
15 He makes all their hearts; their works are clear to him.
16 A king's salvation is not in the power of his army; a strong man does not get free by his great strength.
17 A horse is a false hope; his great power will not make any man free from danger.
18 See, the eye of the Lord is on those in whose hearts is the fear of him, on those whose hope is in his mercy;
19 To keep their souls from death; and to keep them living in time of need.
20 Our souls are waiting for the Lord; he is our help and our salvation.
21 For in him our hearts have joy; in his holy name is our hope.
22 Let your mercy be on us, O Lord, as we are waiting for you.
