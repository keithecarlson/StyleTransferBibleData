1 &lt;A Psalm of Praise.&gt; Make a glad sound to the Lord, all the earth.
2 Give worship to the Lord with joy; come before him with a song.
3 Be certain that the Lord is God; it is he who has made us, and we are his; we are his people, and the sheep to whom he gives food.
4 Come into his doors with joy, and into his house with praise; give him honour, blessing his name.
5 For the Lord is good, and his mercy is never-ending; his faith is unchanging through all generations.
