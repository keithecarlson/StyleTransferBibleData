3 There were the arrows of the bow broken, there he put an end to body-cover, sword, and fight. (Selah.)
4 You are shining and full of glory, more than the eternal mountains.
5 Gone is the wealth of the strong, their last sleep has overcome them; the men of war have become feeble.
6 At the voice of your wrath, O God of Jacob, deep sleep has overcome carriage and horse.
7 You, you are to be feared; who may keep his place before you in the time of your wrath?
8 From heaven you gave your decision; the earth, in its fear, gave no sound,
9 When God took his place as judge, for the salvation of the poor on the earth. (Selah.)
10 The ... will give you praise; the rest of ...
11 Give to the Lord your God what is his by right; let all who are round him give offerings to him who is to be feared.
12 He puts an end to the wrath of rulers; he is feared by the kings of the earth.
