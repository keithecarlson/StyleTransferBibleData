1 Let the Lord be praised. Happy is the man who gives honour to the Lord, and has great delight in his laws.
2 His seed will be strong on the earth; blessings will be on the generation of the upright.
3 A store of wealth will be in his house, and his righteousness will be for ever.
4 For the upright there is a light shining in the dark; he is full of grace and pity.
5 All is well for the man who is kind and gives freely to others; he will make good his cause when he is judged.
6 He will not ever be moved; the memory of the upright will be living for ever.
7 He will have no fear of evil news; his heart is fixed, for his hope is in the Lord.
8 His heart is resting safely, he will have no fear, till he sees trouble come on his haters.
9 He has given with open hands to the poor; his righteousness is for ever; his horn will be lifted up with honour.
10 The sinner will see it with grief; he will be wasted away with envy; the desire of the evil-doers will come to nothing.
