1 &lt;Maschil. Of David. A prayer when he was in the hole of the rock.&gt; The sound of my cry went up to the Lord; with my voice I made my prayer for grace to the Lord.
2 I put all my sorrows before him; and made clear to him all my trouble.
3 When my spirit is overcome, your eyes are on my goings; nets have been secretly placed in the way in which I go.
4 Looking to my right side, I saw no man who was my friend: I had no safe place; no one had any care for my soul.
5 I have made my cry to you, O Lord; I have said, You are my safe place, and my heritage in the land of the living.
6 Give ear to my cry, for I am made very low: take me out of the hands of my haters, for they are stronger than I.
7 Take my soul out of prison, so that I may give praise to your name: the upright will give praise because of me; for you have given me a full reward.
