1 &lt;Of David.&gt; Give praise to the Lord, O my soul; let everything in me give praise to his holy name.
2 Give praise to the Lord, O my soul; let not all his blessings go from your memory.
3 He has forgiveness for all your sins; he takes away all your diseases;
4 He keeps back your life from destruction, crowning you with mercy and grace.
5 He makes your mouth full of good things, so that your strength is made new again like the eagle's.
6 The Lord gives decisions in righteousness for all who are in trouble.
7 He gave knowledge of his way to Moses, and made his acts clear to the children of Israel.
8 The Lord is kind and full of pity, not quickly made angry, but ever ready to have mercy.
9 His feeling will no longer be bitter; he will not keep his wrath for ever.
10 He has not given us the punishment for our sins, or the reward of our wrongdoing.
11 For as the heaven is high over the earth, so great is his mercy to his worshippers.
12 As far as the east is from the west, so far has he put our sins from us.
13 As a father has pity on his children, so the Lord has pity on his worshippers.
14 For he has knowledge of our feeble frame; he sees that we are only dust.
15 As for man, his days are as grass: his beautiful growth is like the flower of the field.
16 The wind goes over it and it is gone; and its place sees it no longer.
17 But the mercy of the Lord is eternal for his worshippers, and their children's children will see his righteousness;
18 If they keep his agreement, and have his laws in mind to do them.
19 The Lord has made ready his high seat in the heavens; his kingdom is ruling over all.
20 Give praise to the Lord, you his angels, who are great in strength, doing his orders, and waiting for his voice.
21 Give praise to the Lord, all you his armies; and you his servants who do his pleasure.
22 Give praise to the Lord, all his works, in all places under his rule: give praise to the Lord, O my soul.
