1 I have given my love to the Lord, because he has given ear to the voice of my cry and my prayer.
2 He has let my request come before him, and I will make my prayer to him all my days.
3 The nets of death were round me, and the pains of the underworld had me in their grip; I was full of trouble and sorrow.
4 Then I made my prayer to the Lord, saying, O Lord, take my soul out of trouble.
5 The Lord is full of grace and righteousness; truly, he is a God of mercy.
6 The Lord keeps the simple; I was made low, and he was my saviour.
7 Come back to your rest, O my soul; for the Lord has given you your reward.
8 You have taken my soul from the power of death, keeping my eyes from weeping, and my feet from falling.
9 I will go before the Lord in the land of the living.
10 I still had faith, though I said, I am in great trouble;
11 Though I said in my fear, All men are false.
12 What may I give to the Lord for all the good things which he has done for me?
13 I will take the cup of salvation, and give praise to the name of the Lord.
14 I will make the offering of my oath to the Lord, even before all his people.
15 Dear in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his saints.
16 O Lord, truly I am your servant; I am your servant, the son of her who is your servant; by you have my cords been broken.
17 I will give an offering of praise to you, and make my prayer in the name of the Lord.
18 I will make the offerings of my oath, even before all his people;
19 In the Lord's house, even in Jerusalem. Praise be to the Lord.
