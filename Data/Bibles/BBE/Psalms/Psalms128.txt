1 &lt;A Song of the going up.&gt; Happy is the worshipper of the Lord, who is walking in his ways.
2 You will have the fruit of the work of your hands: happy will you be, and all will be well for you.
3 Your wife will be like a fertile vine in the inmost parts of your house: your children will be like olive plants round your table.
4 See! this is the blessing of the worshipper of the Lord.
5 May the Lord send you blessing out of Zion: may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
6 May you see your children's children. Peace be on Israel.
