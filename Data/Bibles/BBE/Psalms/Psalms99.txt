1 The Lord is King; let the peoples be in fear: his seat is on the winged ones; let the earth be moved.
2 The Lord is great in Zion; he is high over all the nations.
3 Let them give praise to your name, for it is great and to be feared; holy is he.
4 The king's power is used for righteousness; you give true decisions, judging rightly in the land of Jacob.
5 Give high honour to the Lord our God, worshipping at his feet; holy is he.
6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among those who gave honour to his name; they made prayers to the Lord, and he gave answers to them.
7 His voice came to them from the pillar of cloud; they kept his witness, and the law which he gave them.
8 You gave them an answer, O Lord our God; you took away their sin, though you gave them punishment for their wrongdoing.
9 Give high honour to the Lord our God, worshipping with your faces turned to his holy hill; for the Lord our God is holy.
