1 &lt;To the chief music-maker. A Psalm. Of David.&gt; The heavens are sounding the glory of God; the arch of the sky makes clear the work of his hands.
2 Day after day it sends out its word, and night after night it gives knowledge.
3 There are no words or language; their voice makes no sound.
4 Their line has gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them has he put a tent for the sun,
5 Who is like a newly married man coming from his bride-tent, and is glad like a strong runner starting on his way.
6 His going out is from the end of the heaven, and his circle to the ends of it; there is nothing which is not open to his heat.
7 The law of the Lord is good, giving new life to the soul: the witness of the Lord is certain, giving wisdom to the foolish.
8 The orders of the Lord are right, making glad the heart: the rule of the Lord is holy, giving light to the eyes.
9 The fear of the Lord is clean, and has no end; the decisions of the Lord are true and full of righteousness.
10 More to be desired are they than gold, even than much shining gold; sweeter than the dropping honey.
11 By them is your servant made conscious of danger, and in keeping them there is great reward.
12 Who has full knowledge of his errors? make me clean from secret evil.
13 Keep your servant back from sins of pride; let them not have rule over me: then will I be upright and free from great sin.
14 Let the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be pleasing in your eyes, O Lord, my strength and my salvation.
