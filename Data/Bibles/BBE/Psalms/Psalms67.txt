1 &lt;To the chief music-maker. With corded instruments. A Psalm. A Song.&gt; May God give us mercy and blessing, and let the light of his face be shining on us; (Selah.)
2 So that men may see your way on the earth, and your salvation among all nations.
3 Let the peoples give you praise, O God; let all the peoples give you praise.
4 O let the nations be glad, and make song of joy; for you will be the judge of the peoples in righteousness, guiding the nations of the earth. (Selah.)
5 Let the peoples give you praise, O God; let all the peoples give you praise.
6 The earth has given her increase; and God, even our God, will give us his blessing.
7 God will give us his blessing; so let all the ends of the earth be in fear of him.
