1 &lt;A Psalm. Of David.&gt; The Lord takes care of me as his sheep; I will not be without any good thing.
2 He makes a resting-place for me in the green fields: he is my guide by the quiet waters.
3 He gives new life to my soul: he is my guide in the ways of righteousness because of his name.
4 Yes, though I go through the valley of deep shade, I will have no fear of evil; for you are with me, your rod and your support are my comfort.
5 You make ready a table for me in front of my haters: you put oil on my head; my cup is overflowing.
6 Truly, blessing and mercy will be with me all the days of my life; and I will have a place in the house of the Lord all my days.
