1 &lt;A Song of the going up. Of David.&gt; Lord, there is no pride in my heart and my eyes are not lifted up; and I have not taken part in great undertakings, or in things over-hard for me.
2 See, I have made my soul calm and quiet, like a child on its mother's breast; my soul is like a child on its mother's breast.
3 O Israel, have hope in the Lord, from this time and for ever.
