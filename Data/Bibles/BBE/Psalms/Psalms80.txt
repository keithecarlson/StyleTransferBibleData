1 &lt;To the chief music-maker; put to Shoshannim-eduth. Of Asaph. A Psalm.&gt; Give ear, O Keeper of Israel, guiding Joseph like a flock; you who have your seat on the winged ones, let your glory be seen.
2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, let your strength be awake from sleep, and come as our salvation.
3 Take us back again, O God; let us see the shining of your face, and let us be safe.
4 O Lord God of armies, how long will your wrath be burning against the rest of your people?
5 You have given them the bread of weeping for food; for their drink you have given them sorrow in great measure.
6 You make us a cause of war among our neighbours; our haters are laughing at us among themselves.
7 Take us back again, O God of armies; let us see the shining of your face, and let us be safe.
8 You took a vine out of Egypt: driving out the nations, and planting it in their land.
9 You made ready a place for it, so that it might take deep root, and it sent out its branches over all the land.
10 The mountains were covered with its shade, and the great trees with its branches.
11 It sent out its arms to the Sea, and its branches to the River.
12 Why are its walls broken down by your hands, so that all who go by may take its fruit?
13 It is uprooted by the pigs from the woods, the beasts of the field get their food from it.
14 Come back, O God of armies: from heaven let your eyes be turned to this vine, and give your mind to it,
15 Even to the tree which was planted by your right hand, and to the branch which you made strong for yourself.
16 It is burned with fire; it is cut down: they are made waste by the wrath of your face.
17 Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.
18 So will we not be turned back from you; keep us in life, and we will give praise to your name.
19 Take us back, O Lord God of armies; let us see the shining of your face, and let us be safe.
