1 &lt;To the chief music-maker; on Neginoth. Maschil. Of David. When the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Is not David keeping himself secret among us?&gt; Let your name be my salvation, O God; let my cause be judged by your strength.
2 Let my prayer come before you, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
3 For men who are going after me have come out against me, violent men are purposing to take my soul; they have not put God before their eyes. (Selah.)
4 See, God is my helper: the Lord is the great supporter of my soul.
5 Let the evil works of my haters come back on them again; let them be cut off by your good faith.
6 Freely will I make my offerings to you; I will give praise to your name, O Lord, for it is good.
7 Because it has been my saviour from all my trouble; and my eyes have seen the punishment of my haters.
