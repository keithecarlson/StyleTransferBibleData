1 &lt;A Psalm. A Song for the Sabbath.&gt; It is a good thing to give praise to the Lord, and to make melody to your name, O Most High;
2 To make clear your mercy in the morning, and your unchanging faith every night;
3 On a ten-corded instrument, and on an instrument of music with a quiet sound.
4 For you, O Lord, have made me glad through your work; I will have joy in the works of your hands.
5 O Lord, how great are your works! and your thoughts are very deep.
6 A man without sense has no knowledge of this; and a foolish man may not take it in.
7 When the sinners come up like the grass, and all the workers of evil do well for themselves, it is so that their end may be eternal destruction.
8 But you, O Lord, are on high for ever.
9 For see! your haters, O Lord, will be put to death; all the workers of evil will be put to flight;
10 But my horn is lifted up like the horn of the ox: the best oil is flowing on my head.
11 My eyes have seen trouble come on my haters; my ears have news of the fate of the evil-doers who have come up against me.
12 The good man will be like a tall tree in his strength; his growth will be as the wide-stretching trees of Lebanon.
13 Those who are planted in the house of the Lord will come up tall and strong in his gardens.
14 They will give fruit even when they are old; they will be fertile and full of growth;
15 For a sign that the Lord is upright; he is my Rock, there is no deceit in him.
