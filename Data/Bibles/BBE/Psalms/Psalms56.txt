1 &lt;To the chief music-maker; put to Jonath elem rehokim. Of David. Michtam. When the Philistines took him in Gath.&gt; Have mercy on me, O God, for man is attempting my destruction; every day he makes cruel attacks against me.
2 My haters are ever ready to put an end to me; great numbers are lifting themselves up against me.
3 In the time of my fear, I will have faith in you.
4 In God will I give praise to his word; in God have I put my hope; I will have no fear of what flesh may do to me.
5 Every day they make wrong use of my words; all their thoughts are against me for evil.
6 They come together, they are waiting in secret places, they take note of my steps, they are waiting for my soul.
7 By evil-doing they will not get free from punishment. In wrath, O God, let the peoples be made low.
8 You have seen my wanderings; put the drops from my eyes into your bottle; are they not in your record?
9 When I send up my cry to you, my haters will be turned back; I am certain of this, for God is with me.
10 In God will I give praise to his word; in the Lord will I give praise to his word.
11 In God have I put my hope, I will have no fear of what man may do to me.
12 I keep the memory of my debt to you, O God; I will give you the offerings of praise.
13 Because you have taken my soul from the power of death; and kept my feet from falling, so that I may be walking before God in the light of life.
