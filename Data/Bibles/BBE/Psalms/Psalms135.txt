1 Let the Lord be praised. O you servants of the Lord, give praise to the name of the Lord.
2 You who are in the house of the Lord, and in the open spaces of the house of our God,
3 Give praise to Jah, for he is good: make melody to his name, for it is pleasing.
4 For the Lord has taken Jacob for himself, and Israel for his property.
5 I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is greater than all other gods.
6 The Lord has done whatever was pleasing to him, in heaven, and on the earth, in the seas and in all the deep waters.
7 He makes the mists go up from the ends of the earth; he makes thunder-flames for the rain; he sends out the winds from his store-houses.
8 He put to death the first-fruits of Egypt, of man and of beast.
9 He sent signs and wonders among you, O Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his servants.
10 He overcame great nations, and put strong kings to death;
11 Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan;
12 And gave their land for a heritage, even for a heritage to Israel his people.
13 O Lord, your name is eternal; and the memory of you will have no end.
14 For the Lord will be judge of his people's cause; his feelings will be changed to his servants.
15 The images of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
16 They have mouths, but no voice, they have eyes, but they do not see;
17 They have ears, but no hearing; and there is no breath in their mouths.
18 Those who make them are like them; and so is everyone who puts his hope in them.
19 Give praise to the Lord, O children of Israel: give praise to the Lord, O sons of Aaron:
20 Give praise to the Lord, O sons of Levi: let all the worshippers of the Lord give him praise.
21 Praise be to the Lord out of Zion, even to the Lord whose house is in Jerusalem, Let the Lord be praised.
