1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
2 "How long will you speak these things? Shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?
3 Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?
4 If your children have sinned against him, He has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience.
5 If you want to seek God diligently, make your supplication to the Almighty.
6 If you were pure and upright, surely now he would awaken for you, and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous.
7 Though your beginning was small, yet your latter end would greatly increase.
8 "Please inquire of past generations. Find out about the learning of their fathers.
9 (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days on earth are a shadow.)
10 Shall they not teach you, tell you, and utter words out of their heart?
11 "Can the papyrus grow up without mire? Can the rushes grow without water?
12 While it is yet in its greenness, not cut down, it withers before any other reed.
13 So are the paths of all who forget God. The hope of the godless man shall perish,
14 Whose confidence shall break apart, Whose trust is a spider's web.
15 He shall lean on his house, but it shall not stand. He shall cling to it, but it shall not endure.
16 He is green before the sun. His shoots go out along his garden.
17 His roots are wrapped around the rock pile. He sees the place of stones.
18 If he is destroyed from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, 'I have not seen you.'
19 Behold, this is the joy of his way: out of the earth, others shall spring.
20 "Behold, God will not cast away a blameless man, neither will he uphold the evildoers.
21 He will still fill your mouth with laughter, your lips with shouting.
22 Those who hate you shall be clothed with shame. The tent of the wicked shall be no more."
