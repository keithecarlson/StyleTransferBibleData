1 Brothers, even if a person is caught in some trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a person in a spirit of humility, looking out for yourself, lest you also be tempted. 
2 Carry the burdens of one another, and so fulfill the law of Christ. 
3 For if anyone thinks he is something although he is nothing, he is deceiving himself. 
4 But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have a reason for boasting in himself alone, and not in someone else. 
5 For each one will carry his own burden.
6 Now the one who is taught the word must share in all good things with the one who teaches. 
7 Do not be deceived: God is not to be mocked, for whatever a person sows, this he will also reap, 
8 because the one who sows to his own flesh will reap corruption from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit. 
9 And let us not grow weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap, if we do not give up. 
10 So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, and especially to those who belong to the household of faith.
11 See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand. 
12 As many as are wanting to make a good showing in the flesh, these are attempting to compel you to be circumcised, only so that they will not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. 
13 For not even those who are circumcised observe the law themselves, but they want you to be circumcised in order that they may boast in your flesh. 
14 But as for me, may it never be that I boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. 
15 For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. 
16 And all those who follow this rule, peace and mercy be on them and on the Israel of God.
17 Finally, let no one cause me trouble, for I carry on my body the marks of Jesus. 
18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
