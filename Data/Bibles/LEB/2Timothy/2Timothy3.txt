1 But know this, that in the last days difficult times will come, 
2 for people will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, arrogant, slanderers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, 
3 hardhearted, irreconcilable, slanderous, without self-control, savage, with no interest for what is good, 
4 traitors, reckless, conceited, loving pleasure rather than loving God, 
5 maintaining a form of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid these people. 
6 For from these are those who slip into houses and captivate foolish women loaded down with sins, led by various kinds of desires, 
7 always learning and never able to come to a knowledge of the truth. 
8 And just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these oppose the truth, people corrupted in mind, disqualified concerning the faith. 
9 But they will not progress to a greater extent, for their folly will be quite evident to everyone, as also the folly of those two was.
10 But you have faithfully followed my teaching, way of life, purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance, 
11 persecutions, and sufferings that happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, and in Lystra, what sort of persecutions I endured, and the Lord delivered me from all of them. 
12 And indeed, all those who want to live in a godly manner in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. 
13 But evil people and imposters will progress to the worse, deceiving and being deceived. 
14 But you continue in the things which you have learned and are convinced of, because you know from whom you learned them, 
15 and that from childhood you have known the holy writings that are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 
16 All scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness, 
17 in order that the person of God may be competent, equipped for every good work.
