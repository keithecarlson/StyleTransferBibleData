1 Thus says Yahweh: "Where is this divorce document of your mother's divorce, with which I dismissed her? or to whom of my creditors did I sell you? Look! you were sold because of your sin, and your mother was dismissed because of your transgressions.
2 Why was there no man when I came, no one who answered when I called? Do I lack the strength to save? Or is there no power in me to deliver? Look! by my rebuke I dry up the sea; I make the rivers a desert; their fish stink because there is no water, and they die because of thirst.
3 I clothe the heavens with darkness, and I make their covering sackcloth."
4 The Lord Yahweh has given me the tongue of a pupil, to know how to help the weary with a word. He awakens morning by morning, awakens an ear for me to listen as do the pupils.
5 The Lord Yahweh has opened an ear for me, and I, I was not rebellious. I did not turn backwards;
6 I gave my back to those who struck me, and my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard; I did not hide my face from insults and spittle.
7 And the Lord Yahweh helps me, therefore I have not been put to shame; therefore I have set my face like flint. And I know that I shall not be ashamed;
8 he who obtains rights for me is near. Who will contend with me? Let us stand together. Who is the master of my judgment? Let him approach me.
9 Look! The Lord Yahweh helps me. Who is the one who will declare me guilty? Look! All of them will be worn out like a garment; the moth will eat them.
10 Who among you is in fear of Yahweh, obeys the voice of his servant? Who walks in darkness and has no light, trusts in the name of Yahweh and depends on his God?
11 Look! All of you are kindlers of fire, who gird yourselves with flaming arrows. Walk in the light of your fire, and among the flaming arrows you have kindled! You shall have this from my hand: you shall lie down in a place of torment.
