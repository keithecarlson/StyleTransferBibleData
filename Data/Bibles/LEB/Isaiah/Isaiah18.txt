1 Ah! land of the whirring of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Cush,
2 that sends messengers by the sea and in vessels of papyrus on the surface of the waters! Go, swift messengers, to a tall and smooth nation, to a people feared near and far, a mighty, mighty and trampling nation, whose land rivers divide.
3 All you inhabitants of the world and dwellers of the earth, when a signal is raised on the mountains, you must look, and when a trumpet is blown, you must listen!
4 For Yahweh said this to me: "I will be quiet, and I will look from my dwelling place like clear heat because of light, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest."
5 For before the harvest, when the blossom is complete and a blossom becomes ripening fruit, and one cuts off the shoots with pruning hooks, and one removes, tears away the tendrils.
6 They shall all be left for birds of prey of the mountains and for the animals of the earth. And the birds of prey will pass the summer on it, and every animal of the earth will winter on it.
7 At that time, a gift will be brought to Yahweh of hosts from a tall and smooth people, and from a people feared near and far, a mighty, mighty and trampling nation, whose land the rivers divide, to the place of the name of Yahweh of hosts, the mountain of Zion.
