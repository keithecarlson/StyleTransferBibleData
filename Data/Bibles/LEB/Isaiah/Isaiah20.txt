1 In the year the commander-in-chief came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and he took it, 
2 at that time, Yahweh had spoken by the hand of Isaiah son of Amoz, saying, "Go and loosen the sackcloth from your loins, and take off your sandals from your feet," and he had done so, walking naked and barefoot.
3 Then Yahweh said, "Just as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years as a sign and a portent against Egypt and Cush, 
4 so shall the king of Assyria lead the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot, with bared buttocks, the shame of Egypt.
5 And they shall be dismayed, and they shall be ashamed because of Cush, their hope, and because of Egypt, their pride.
6 And the inhabitant of the coastland will say this on that day: 'Look! This is our hope to whom we fled for help, to be delivered from the king of Assyria, and how shall we escape?'"
