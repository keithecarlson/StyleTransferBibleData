1 And seven women shall grasp at one man on that day, saying, "We will eat our own bread, and we will wear our own clothing; only let us be called by your name! Take away our disgrace!"
2 On that day the branch of Yahweh shall become beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall become the pride and glory of the survivors of Israel.
3 And this shall happen: He who is left in Zion and he who remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone written for life in Jerusalem,
4 when the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed the blood of Jerusalem from her midst by a spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning.
5 Then Yahweh will create over all of the site of Mount Zion and over her assembly a cloud by day and smoke and the brightness of flaming fire by night. Indeed, over all the glory there will be a canopy,
6 and it will be a shelter for shade from the heat by day, and a refuge and a hiding place from rainstorm and from rain.
