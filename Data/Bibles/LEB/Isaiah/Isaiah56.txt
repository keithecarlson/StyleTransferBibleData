1 Thus says Yahweh: "Observe justice and do righteousness, for my salvation is close to coming, and my justice to being revealed.
2 Happy is the man who does this, and the son of humankind who keeps hold of it, who keeps the Sabbath so as not to profane it, and who keeps his hand from doing any evil."
3 And do not let the foreigner who joins himself to Yahweh say, "Surely Yahweh will separate me from his people." And do not let the eunuch say, "Look! I am a dry tree!"

11 And the dogs have a greedy appetite; they are never satisfied. And they are the shepherds! They do not have understanding. They all turn to their own way, each one for his own gain, every one of them.
12 "Come, let me take wine, and let us carouse with intoxicating drink, and tomorrow will be like today, very great indeed."
