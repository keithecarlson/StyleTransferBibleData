1 An oracle of Moab: Because Ar is devastated in a night, Moab is destroyed; because Kir of Moab is devastated in a night, it is destroyed.
2 It has gone up to the house, and Dibon to the high places for weeping over Nebo, and Moab wails over Medeba. Every head is bald, every beard is shaved.
3 They gird themselves with sackcloth in its streets; on its roofs and public squares everyone wails, going down in weeping.
4 And Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, their voice is heard as far as Jahaz; therefore the armed ones of Moab cry out; its soul quivers for him.
5 My heart cries out for Moab; its fugitives flee up to Zoar, to Eglath-shelishiyah. For at the ascent of Luhith it goes up it with weeping; for on the road of Horonaim they raise up a cry of destruction.
6 For the waters of Nimrim are wastelands; for the grass has withered, the vegetation has vanished, there is no greenness.
7 Therefore they carry the abundance it has made and their store of goods over the river of the poplars.
8 For a cry for help has encircled the territory of Moab, her wailing is heard as far as Eglaim, and her wailing as far as Beer Elim.
9 For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; but I will place added things upon Dimon: a lion for the survivors of Moab and for the remnant of the land.
