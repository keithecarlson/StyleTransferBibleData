1 Ah! Those who go down to Egypt for help! They rely on horses and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very numerous, and they do not look to the holy one of Israel, and they do not consult Yahweh.
2 And indeed, he is wise, and he brings disaster, and he does not remove his words, and he will rise against the house of evildoers and against the help of workers of iniquity.
3 And the Egyptians are human and not God, and their horses are flesh and not spirit. And Yahweh stretches out his hand, and the helper will stumble, and the one being helped will fall, and together all of them will come to an end.
4 For Yahweh said this to me: "As which a lion growls and a young lion over its prey when a full group of shepherds is called against him, it is not terrified by their voice, and to their noise it does not respond, so Yahweh of hosts will come down to fight upon Mount Zion and upon its hill.
5 Like birds flying overhead, so Yahweh of hosts will protect Jerusalem; he will protect and deliver it; he will pass over and rescue it.
6 Turn back to the one against whom the sons of Israel have made deep rebellion.
7 For on that day, each one will reject his idols of silver and his idols of gold which your hands have made in sin for you.
8 And Assyria shall fall by a sword not of a man, and a sword not of a human shall devour him; and he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be put to forced labor.
9 And his rock will pass over because of terror, and his officers will be terrified because of the flag," declares Yahweh, who has a fire in Zion and has a furnace in Jerusalem.
