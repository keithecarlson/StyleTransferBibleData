1 And you will say on that day, "I will give you thanks, Yahweh, for though you were angry with me, your anger turned away, and you comforted me.
2 Look! God is my salvation; I will trust, and I will not be afraid, for my strength and might is Yah, Yahweh; and he has become salvation for me."
3 And you will draw water from the wells of salvation in joy. 
4 And you will say on that day, "Give thanks to Yahweh; call on his name. Make his deeds known among the peoples; bring to remembrance that his name is exalted.
5 Sing praises to Yahweh, for he has done a glorious thing; this is known in all the earth.
6 Inhabitant of Zion, shout out and sing for joy, for the holy one of Israel is great in your midst."
