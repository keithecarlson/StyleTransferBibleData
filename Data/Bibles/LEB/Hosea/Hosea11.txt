1 When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.
2 When I called them, they went from my face. They sacrificed to the Baals, and they sacrificed to idols.
3 And I myself taught Ephraim to walk; I took them in my arms, but they did not know that I healed them.
4 I drew them with human ties, with the bands of love. I was to them like one who lifted up a yoke on their jaws, though I bent down to them and let them eat.
5 He will return to the land of Egypt, and Assyria will be his king, because they refused to return.
6 The sword rages in his cities; it consumes his false prophets and devours because of their plans.
7 My people are bent on backsliding from me. To the Most High they call, he does not raise them at all.
8 How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How can I hand you over, O Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart is disturbed within me; all my compassions are aroused.
9 I will not execute my fierce anger, I will not again destroy Ephraim; because I am God and not a mortal, the Holy One in your midst; and I will not come in wrath.
10 They will go after Yahweh; he roars like a lion. When he roars, his children will come trembling from the sea.
11 They will tremble like birds from Egypt, and like doves from the land of Assyria; and I will let them return to their homes— a declaration of Yahweh.
12  Ephraim has surrounded me with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit; and Judah is still wandering with God and is faithful to the Holy One.
