1 I will bless Yahweh at all times; his praise shall be in my mouth continually.
2 My soul makes its boast in Yahweh; let the humble hear and be glad.
3 Magnify Yahweh with me, and let us exalt his name together.
4 I sought Yahweh and he answered me, and from all my terrors he delivered me.
5 They looked to him and were radiant, and their faces shall not be ashamed.
6 This poor man called and Yahweh heard, and saved him from all his troubles.
7 The angel of Yahweh encamps around those who fear him, and he rescues them.
8 Taste and see that Yahweh is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.
9 Fear Yahweh, you his saints, for there is no lack for those who fear him.
10 The young lions are in want and suffer hunger, but those who seek Yahweh will not lack for any good thing.
11 Come, you children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of Yahweh.
12 Who is the man who desires life, who loves many days in order to see good?
13 Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit.
14 Turn from evil and do good. Seek peace and pursue it.
15 The eyes of Yahweh are toward the righteous, and his ears toward their cry for help.
16 The face of Yahweh is against evildoers, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
17 They cry out and Yahweh hears and delivers them from all of their troubles.
18 Yahweh is near to those who are heartbroken and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
19 Many are the distresses of the righteous, but Yahweh delivers him out of them all.
20 He protects all his bones; not one of them is broken.
21 Evil will slay the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will incur guilt.
22 Yahweh redeems the life of his servants, and none who take refuge in him will incur guilt.
