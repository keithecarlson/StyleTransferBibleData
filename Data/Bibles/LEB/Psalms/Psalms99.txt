1 Yahweh is king; let the peoples tremble. He sits enthroned between the cherubim. Let the earth shake.
2 Yahweh is great in Zion, and he is exalted over all the peoples.
3 Let them praise your great and fearful name. He is holy.
4 And the strength of the king loves justice. You have established equity; you have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.
5 Exalt Yahweh our God, and worship at his footstool. He is holy.
6 Moses and Aaron were among his priests; Samuel also was among those who called on his name. They called to Yahweh, and he answered them.
7 He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud. They kept his testimonies and the statute he gave to them.
8 O Yahweh our God, you answered them. You were a forgiving God to them, but an avenger of their wrong deeds.
9 Exalt Yahweh our God, and worship at his holy mountain, for Yahweh our God is holy.
