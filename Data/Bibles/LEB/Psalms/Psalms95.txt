1 Come, let us sing for joy to Yahweh; let us shout joyfully to the rock of our salvation.
2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; with songs let us shout joyfully to him.
3 For Yahweh is the great God, and the great king over all gods,
4 in whose hand are the unexplored places of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are his,
5 to whom belongs the sea that he made,  and the dry land that his hands formed.
6 Come in, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before Yahweh, our maker.
7 For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. Today if you will hear his voice:
8 "Do not harden your heart as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the wilderness,
9 when your ancestors tried me. They put me to the test, even though they had seen my work.
10 For forty years I loathed that generation, and said, 'They are a people whose heart wanders. And my ways they do not know.'
11 Therefore I swore in my anger, 'They shall surely not enter into my rest.'"
