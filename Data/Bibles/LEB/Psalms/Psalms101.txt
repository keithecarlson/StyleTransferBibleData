1 I will sing of loyal love and justice; I will sing praises to you, O Yahweh.
2 I will give attention to the way of integrity. When will you come to me? I will walk in the integrity of my heart in the midst of my house.
3 I will not set before my eyes any wicked thing. I hate the work of those who fall away; it will not cling to me.
4 A perverse heart will depart from me; I will not know evil.
5 One who slanders his neighbor in secret, him I will destroy. One haughty of eyes and arrogant of heart, him I will not endure.
6 My eyes will be on the faithful of the land, that they may live with me. He who walks in the way of integrity, he shall minister to me.
7 There will not live in the midst of my house a worker of deceit. One who speaks lies will not remain before my eyes.
8 Each morning, I will destroy all the wicked of the land, cutting off from the city of Yahweh all evildoers.
