1 Only for God my soul waits in silence. From him is my salvation.
2 Only he is my rock and my salvation, my high stronghold; I shall not be greatly shaken.
3 How long will you attack a man? All of you will be shattered like a leaning wall, a tottering fence.
4 They only plan to thrust him down from his high position; they are pleased with deception. With their mouths they bless, but inwardly they curse. Selah
5 Only for God wait in silence, O my soul, because my hope is from him.
6 Only he is my rock and my salvation, my high stronghold; I shall not be shaken.
7 On God rests my salvation and my glory; God is my strong rock, my refuge.
8 Trust him at all times, O people; pour out before him your heart. God is a refuge for us. Selah
9 Only a vapor are men of low degree, a deception are men of high degree. Weighed in a balance, together they are lighter than a vapor.
10 Do not trust in extortion, and do not put vain confidence in robbery. If wealth increases, do not set your heart on it.
11 Once God has spoken; twice I have heard this: that strength belongs to God.
12 And to you belongs loyal love, O Lord, because you will render to each according to his work.
