1 My heart is steadfast, O God. I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.
2 Awake, harp and lyre. I will awake the dawn.
3 I will give you thanks among the peoples, O Yahweh; I will give you praise among the nations,
4 because your loyal love is great above the heavens, and your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
5 Be exalted above the heavens, O God, and let your glory be above all the earth,
6 so that your beloved ones may be rescued. Save by your right hand and answer me.
7 God has spoken in his holiness, "I will exult, I will divide up Shechem, and portion out the valley of Succoth.
8 Gilead is mine. Manasseh is mine. And Ephraim is the helmet for my head. Judah is my scepter;
9 Moab is my washing pot. Over Edom I will cast my sandal; Over Philistia I will shout in triumph."
10 Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
11 Have you not rejected us, O God, and not gone out with our armies, O God?
12 Give us help against the enemy, for the help of humankind is futile.
13 Through God we will do valiantly, and it is he who will tread down our enemies.
