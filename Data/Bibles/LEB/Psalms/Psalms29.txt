1 Ascribe to Yahweh, O sons of God, ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength.
2 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due his name. Worship Yahweh in holy array.
3 The voice of Yahweh is over the waters; the God of glory thunders. Yahweh is over many waters.
4 The voice of Yahweh is powerful. The voice of Yahweh is majestic.
5 The voice of Yahweh breaks the cedars. Yahweh shatters even the cedars of Lebanon.
6 And he makes them skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild ox.
7 The voice of Yahweh flashes flames of fire.
8 The voice of Yahweh shakes the wilderness. Yahweh shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
9 The voice of Yahweh causes deer to give birth and strips the forests bare. And at his temple all in it say, "Glory!"
10 Yahweh sits enthroned at the flood, and Yahweh sits as king forever.
11 May Yahweh give strength to his people. May Yahweh bless his people with peace.
