1 Save, O Yahweh, for the pious have ceased to be; for the faithful have vanished from among the children of humankind.
2 They speak falseness to each other. With flattering lips, with a double heart they speak.
3 May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips, the tongue speaking great boasts—
4 those who say, "With our tongue we will prevail. Our lips are on our side. Who is master over us?"
5 "Because of the oppression of the afflicted, because of the groaning of the poor, now I will rise up," Yahweh says. "I shall put them in the safety for which they long."
6 The words of Yahweh are pure words like silver refined in the crucible on the ground, refined seven times.
7 You, O Yahweh, will protect them. You will preserve him from this generation always.
8 The wicked prowl about when vileness is exalted among the children of humankind.
