1 Sing to Yahweh a new song; sing to Yahweh, all the earth.
2 Sing to Yahweh; bless his name. Announce his salvation from day to day.
3 Tell his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples.
4 For Yahweh is great and very worthy of praise; he is to be feared above all gods.
5 For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but Yahweh made the heavens.
6 Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
7 Ascribe to Yahweh, you families of the peoples, ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength.
8 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due his name; bring an offering and come into his courts.
9 Worship Yahweh in holy array; tremble before him, all the earth.
10 Say among the nations, "Yahweh is king! Yes, the world is established so that it will not be moved. He will judge the peoples fairly."
11 Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice. Let the sea with its fullness roar.
12 Let the field with all that is in it exult. Then all the trees of the forests will sing for joy
13 before Yahweh, for he is coming; for he is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with his faithfulness.
