1 Blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh, who walks in his ways.
2 You will indeed eat of the labor of your hands; you will be happy and it will be well with you.
3 Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house. Your children will be like olive shoots about your table.
4 Look, for thus shall a man be blessed who fears Yahweh.
5 May Yahweh bless you from Zion, that you may see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life,
6 and that you may see your children's children. May peace be upon Israel.
