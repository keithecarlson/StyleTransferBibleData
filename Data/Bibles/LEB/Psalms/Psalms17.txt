1 O Yahweh, hear a just cause. Hear my cry; heed my prayer I make without deceitful lips.
2 Let my vindication come forth from you; let your eyes see fairness.
3 You have tried my heart; you have examined me by night; you have tested me; you found nothing. I have decided that my mouth will not transgress.
4 As for the works of humankind, by the word of your lips, I have kept from the ways of the violent.
5 I have held my steps in your path My feet will not slip.
6 As for me, I have called on you because you will answer me, O God. Incline your ear to me. Hear my words.
7 Show wondrously your acts of loyal love, O Savior of those who take refuge at your right hand from those who rise up against them.
8 Keep me as the apple of your eye. Hide me in the shadow of your wings
9 from the presence of the wicked who destroy me, those enemies against my life, they that surround me.
10 They have shut off their calloused heart; with their mouth they speak arrogantly.
11 Now they surround us at our every step. They intend to pin me to the ground.
12 He is like a lion; he longs to tear apart, and like a strong lion crouching in hiding places.
13 Rise up, O Yahweh, confront him. Make him bow down. Rescue with your sword my life from the wicked,
14 from men by your hand, O Yahweh, from men of this world. Their share is in this life, and you fill their stomach with your treasure. They are satisfied with children. They bequeath their excess to their children.
15 By contrast, I in righteousness shall see your face. Upon awakening I will be satisfied seeing your form.
