1 When Yahweh restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like dreamers.
2 Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with rejoicing. Then they said among the nations, "Yahweh has done great things for these people."
3 Yahweh has done great things for us; we are glad.
4 Restore, O Yahweh, our fortunes like the streams in the Negeb.
5 Those who sow with tears shall reap with rejoicing.
6 He who diligently goes out with weeping, carrying the seed bag, shall certainly come in with rejoicing, carrying his sheaves.
