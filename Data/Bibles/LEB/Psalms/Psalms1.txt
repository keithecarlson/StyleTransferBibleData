1 Blessed is the man who does not walk in the advice of the wicked; nor does he stand in the way of sinners; nor does he sit in the assembly of mockers.
2 Instead, in the law of Yahweh is his delight, and on his law he meditates day and night.
3 And so, he is like a tree planted by streams of water that gives its fruit in its season; its leaf also does not wither. Therefore all that he does prospers.
4 Not so the wicked. Instead, they are like the chaff that the wind scatters.
5 Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;
6 for Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.
