2 Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
3 Glorious things are spoken about you, O city of God. Selah
4 I will record those who know me in Rahab and Babylon, behold in Philistia and Tyre with Cush, "This one was born there."
5 But with respect to Zion it shall be said, "Each one was born in her," for the Most High himself will establish her.
6 Yahweh will record in writing the peoples, "This one was born there." Selah
7 And while dancing, singers will sing, "All my springs are in you."
