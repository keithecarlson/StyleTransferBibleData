1 Hear, O God, my cry; attend to my prayer.
2 From the end of the earth I call to you when my heart grows faint. You will lead me to a rock that is higher than I.
3 For you have been my refuge, a strong tower from the enemy.
4 Let me reside in your tent forever. Let me take refuge under the covering of your wings. Selah
5 For you, O God, you have heard my vows. You have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.
6 You will add days to the days of the king, his years like those of many generations.
7 May he live forever in the presence of God. Appoint loyal love and faithfulness to preserve him.
8 So I will sing the praise of your name forever, that I may fulfill my vows daily.
