1 I cry out with my voice to Yahweh; I implore favor with my voice to Yahweh.
2 I pour out my complaint before him; I declare my trouble before him.
3 When my spirit faints within me, you know my way. On the path where I walk, they have hidden a trap for me;
4 look to my right and see. There is no one looking out for me; there is no escape for me; no one cares for my soul.
5 I cry out to you, O Yahweh. I say, "You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living."
6 Attend to my cry, for I am brought very low. Deliver me from my pursuers, for they are stronger than I.
7 Bring me out of prison, that I may give thanks to your name. The righteous will encircle me, because you will deal bountifully with me.
