1 In Yahweh I have taken refuge; how can you say to my soul, "Flee to your mountain like a bird"?
2 For look: The wicked string the bow. They have fitted their arrow to the string, to shoot from the darkness at the upright of heart.
3 When the foundations are destroyed what can the righteous do?
4 Yahweh is in his holy temple; Yahweh is in the heavens on his throne. His eyelids see; they test the children of humankind.
5 Yahweh tests the righteous, but the wicked and the lover of violence his soul hates.
6 He will rain coals on the wicked. Burning sulfur and scorching wind will be the portion of their cup.
7 For Yahweh is righteous; he loves righteous deeds. The upright shall see his face.
