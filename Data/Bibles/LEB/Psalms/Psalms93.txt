1 Yahweh is king; he clothes himself with majesty. Yahweh clothes himself; he girds himself with might. Yes, the world is established so that it will not be moved.
2 Your throne is established from of old; you are from everlasting.
3 The rivers have lifted up, O Yahweh; the rivers have lifted up their rumbling; the rivers have lifted up their pounding.
4 Mightier than the rumblings of many waters, mightier than the mighty breakers of the sea, Yahweh on high is mighty.
5 Your testimonies are fully reliable. Holiness is fitting for your house, O Yahweh, forever.
