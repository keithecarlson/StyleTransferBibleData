1 Unless Yahweh builds a house, its builders labor at it in vain. Unless Yahweh guards a city, a guard watches in vain.
2 It is in vain for you who rise early and sit late, eating the bread of anxious toil, when thus he provides for his beloved in his sleep.
3 Look, children are the heritage of Yahweh; the fruit of the womb is a reward.
4 Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so are the children of one's youth.
5 Blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them. They shall not be put to shame when they speak with enemies at the gate.
