1 Praise Yah! Blessed is the man who fears Yahweh; he takes great delight in his commands.
2 His descendants will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed.
3 Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever.
4 His light rises in the darkness for the upright; he is gracious and compassionate and righteous.
5 It goes well for a man who is gracious and lends, who conducts his business properly.
6 For he will not be shaken forever; the righteous will be remembered forever.
7 He is not afraid of bad news; his heart is steadfast, secure in Yahweh.
8 His heart is sustained; he will not be afraid, until he looks in triumph on his enemies.
9 He gives lavishly to the needy; his righteousness endures forever. His horn rises high in honor.
10 The wicked sees it and is vexed. He gnashes his teeth and becomes weak. The desire of the wicked perishes.
