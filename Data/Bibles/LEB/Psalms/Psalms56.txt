1 Be gracious to me, O God, because humankind has trampled me; fighting all the day he oppresses me.
2 My enemies trample all day, because many are attacking me proudly.
3 When I fear, I trust you.
4 God, whose word I praise, God I trust; I do not fear. What can mere flesh do to me?
5 All day they twist my words; all their thoughts are against me for evil.
6 They attack, they hide, they watch my steps, as they lie in wait for my life.
7 Because of iniquity will they escape? In anger cast down the peoples, O God.
8 You have kept count of my wonderings. Put my tears in your bottle; are they not in your book?
9 Then my enemies will turn back when I call. This I know because God is for me.
10 God, whose word I praise, Yahweh, whose word I praise,
11 God I trust; I do not fear. What can mere humankind do to me?
12 My vows to you, O God, are binding upon me. I will pay thank offerings to you,
13 because you have delivered my soul from death. Have you not kept my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
