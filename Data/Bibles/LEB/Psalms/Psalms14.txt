1 The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt. They do abominable deeds. There is none who does good.
2 Yahweh looks down from heaven upon the children of humankind to see whether there is one who has insight, one who cares about God.
3 All have gone astray; they are altogether corrupt. There is not one who does good; there is not even one.
4 All who do evil—do they not know, they who eat my people as though they were eating bread? They do not call on Yahweh.
5 There they are very fearful because God is with the generation of the righteous.
6 You would put to shame the plan of the poor, because Yahweh is his refuge.
7 Oh that from Zion would come salvation for Israel! When Yahweh returns the fortunes of his people, Jacob will rejoice; Israel will be happy.
