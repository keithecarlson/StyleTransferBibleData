1 O God, you have rejected us. You have broken us. You have been angry. Restore us!
2 You have made the land quake. You have split it open. Heal its fissures, because it totters.
3 You have shown your people hard things; You have given us wine that staggers.
4 You have rallied those who fear you round a banner out of bowshot, Selah
5 so that your beloved ones may be rescued. Save by your right hand and answer us.
6 God has spoken in his holiness, "I will rejoice; I will divide up Shechem, and portion out the valley of Succoth.
7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine, and Ephraim is the helmet for my head; Judah is my scepter.
8 Moab is my washing pot; over Edom, I will cast my sandal. On account of me, O Philistia, raise a shout."
9 Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
10 Have not you yourself rejected us, O God, and not gone out with our armies, O God?
11 Give us help against the adversary, for the help of humankind is futile.
12 Through God we will do valiantly, and it is he who will tread down our enemies.
