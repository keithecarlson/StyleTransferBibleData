1 Praise Yah. Praise Yahweh, O my soul.
2 I will praise Yahweh while I live; I will sing praises to my God while I am still alive.
3 Do not place trust in princes, in a son of humankind with whom there is no deliverance.
4 His breath departs; he returns to his plot; on that day his plans perish.
5 Blessed is the one whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is on Yahweh as his God,
6 who made heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in them, the one who keeps faith forever,
7 who executes justice for the oppressed, who gives food for the hungry. Yahweh sets prisoners free;
8 Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind; Yahweh raises up those bowed down; Yahweh loves the righteous;
9 Yahweh protects the strangers. He helps up the orphan and the widow, but the way of the wicked he thwarts.
10 Yahweh will reign forever, Your God, O Zion, throughout all generations. Praise Yah.
