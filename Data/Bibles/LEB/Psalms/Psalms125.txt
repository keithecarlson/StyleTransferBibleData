1 Those who trust in Yahweh are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abides forever.
2 As mountains are round about Jerusalem, so Yahweh is round about his people, from now until forever.
3 For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest on the land of the righteous, lest the righteous stretch out their hands to do wickedness.
4 Do good, O Yahweh, to the good, and to those upright in their hearts.
5 But regarding those who turn aside to their crooked ways, Yahweh will lead them away with the evildoers. Peace be upon Israel.
