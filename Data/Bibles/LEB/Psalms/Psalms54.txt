1 O God, by your name save me, and by your power vindicate me.
2 O God, hear my prayer; heed the words of my mouth.
3 For foreigners have risen against me, and ruthless men seek my life. They have not set God before them. Selah
4 See, God is my helper; The Lord is with those who sustain my life.
5 He will repay my enemies for their evil; in your faithfulness destroy them.
6 I will freely sacrifice to you; I will give thanks to your name, O Yahweh, because it is good.
7 Because he has delivered me from all trouble, and my eye has looked with satisfaction on my enemies.
