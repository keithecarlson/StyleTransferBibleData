1 We give thanks to you, O God; we give thanks, and your name is near. Your wonderful deeds are told.
2 "I will indeed set an appointed time; I will judge fairly.
3 The earth and all its inhabitants are shaking; I steady its columns. Selah
4 I say to the boastful, 'Do not boast!' and to the wicked, 'Do not lift up your horn!
5 Do not lift up high your horn. Do not speak with arrogant pride.'"
6 For it is not from the east or the west and not from the south that lifting up comes,
7 rather God is the judge; one he brings low, and another he lifts up.
8 For there is a cup in the hand of Yahweh with wine that foams, fully mixed, and he pours out from this. Surely all the wicked of the land will quaff it down to its dregs. 
9 But as for me, I will proclaim forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob.
10 "And all the horns of the wicked I will cut off. The horns of the righteous will be lifted up."
