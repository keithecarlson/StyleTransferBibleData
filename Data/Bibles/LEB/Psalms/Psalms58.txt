1 Do you really speak what is right when silent? Do you judge fairly the children of humankind?
2 No, in your heart you plan injustices; in the land you weigh out the violence of your hands.
3 The wicked are estranged from the womb. They go astray from the belly, speaking lies.
4 Their venom is like snake venom; They are like a deaf viper that closes its ear
5 so that it does not hear the voice of charmers or the skilled caster of spells.
6 O God, break their teeth in their mouth. Break off the fangs of the young lions, O Yahweh.
7 Let them run away like water that runs off. When he bends the bow, let his arrows be as though they were cut off.
8 Let them be like a snail that melts away as it goes; like the stillborn of woman that do not see the sun.
9 Before your pots can feel the heat of a thornbush, whether green or dry, he will sweep it away.
10 The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
11 And people will say, "Surely there is a reward for the righteous. Surely there is a God who judges in the land."
