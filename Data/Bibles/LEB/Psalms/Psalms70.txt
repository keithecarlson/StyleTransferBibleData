1 O God, make haste to deliver me. O Yahweh, make haste to help me.
2 Let them be ashamed and abashed who seek my life. Let them be repulsed and humiliated who desire my harm.
3 let them turn back because of their shame, those who say, "Aha! Aha!"
4 Let them rejoice and be glad in you, all those who seek you. Let them say continually, "God is great!" those who love your salvation.
5 But I am poor and needy; O God hasten to me. You are my help and my deliverer. O Yahweh, do not delay.
