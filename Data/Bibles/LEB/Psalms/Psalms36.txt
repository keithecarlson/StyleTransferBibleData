1 An oracle: the wicked has rebellion in the midst of his heart. There is no fear of God before his eyes.
2 For he flatters himself in his eyes, hating to detect his iniquity.
3 The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit. He has ceased to have insight and to do good.
4 He plans sin on his bed. He puts himself on a way that is not good. He does not reject evil.
5 O Yahweh, your loyal love extends into the heavens, your faithfulness unto the clouds.
6 Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, your judgments like the great deep. You save man and beast, O Yahweh.
7 How precious is your loyal love, O God, and the children of humankind take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
8 They are refreshed with the fullness of your house, and you give them drink from the river of your delights.
9 For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.
10 Prolong your loyal love to those who know you, and your righteousness to the upright of heart.
11 Do not let a foot of pride come against me, nor let a wicked hand make me to wander homeless.
12 There doers of evil have fallen; they are thrust down and not able to rise.
