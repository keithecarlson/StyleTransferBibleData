1 I love him, because Yahweh has heard the voice of my supplications.
2 Because he has inclined his ear to me, I will call all my days.
3 The ropes of death encircled me, and the distresses of Sheol found me. I found trouble and grief.
4 Then I called on the name of Yahweh: "O Yahweh, please save my life!"
5 Gracious is Yahweh and righteous, and our God is merciful.
6 Yahweh watches over the simple. I was brought low, but he gave me victory.
7 Return, O my soul, to your repose, for Yahweh has dealt bountifully with you.
8 For you have rescued me from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling.
9 I will walk before Yahweh in the land of the living.
10 I believed when I spoke, "I am afflicted greatly."
11 I said in my haste, "Everyone is a liar."
12 What shall I give back to Yahweh for all his benefits to me?
13 I will lift up the cup of salvation and proclaim the name of Yahweh.
14 I will pay my vows made to Yahweh in the presence of all his people.
15 Costly in Yahweh's view is the death of his faithful ones.
16 Ah, Yahweh, I am indeed your servant; I am your servant, the child of your maidservant. You have loosed my bonds.
17 I will offer to you a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and proclaim the name of Yahweh.
18 I will pay my vows made to Yahweh in the presence of all his people,
19 in the courts of the house of Yahweh, in the midst of you, O Jerusalem. Praise Yah!
