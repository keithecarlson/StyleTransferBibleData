1 All you peoples, clap your hands. Shout to God with a voice of rejoicing.
2 For Yahweh Most High is awesome, a great king over all the earth.
3 He subdues peoples under us and nations under our feet.
4 He chooses for us our inheritance, the pride of Jacob whom he loves.
5 God has gone up with a shout, Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet.
6 Sing praises to God, sing praises. Sing praises to our king, sing praises.
7 For God is king of all the earth. Sing praises with understanding.
8 God reigns over nations; God sits on his holy throne.
9 The princes of the peoples are gathered together with the people of Abraham's God. For the shields of the earth belong to God. He is very exalted.
