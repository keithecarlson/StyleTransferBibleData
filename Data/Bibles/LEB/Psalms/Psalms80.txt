1 Give ear, O shepherd of Israel, who leads Joseph like a flock. Shine forth, you who sits enthroned above the cherubim.
2 Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, stir up your power and come for our salvation.
3 O God, restore us, and cause your face to shine that we may be saved.
4 O Yahweh God of hosts, how long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?
5 You have fed them the bread of tears; you have given them tears to drink in full measure.
6 You have made us an object of strife to our neighbors, and our enemies mock among themselves.
7 O God of hosts, restore us and cause your face to shine that we may be saved.
8 You uprooted a vine from Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it.
9 You prepared a place before it, and it took deep root and filled the land.
10 The mountains were covered with its shade, and the mighty cedars with its boughs.
11 It spread its branches to the sea and its shoots to the river.
12 Why have you broken down its walls, so that all who pass on the road pluck fruit from it?
13 Swine from the forests devour it and creatures of the field feed on it.
14 Please return, O God of hosts. Observe from heaven and see, and pay attention to this vine,
15 eventhe stalk that your right hand planted, and concerning the shoot you strengthened for yourself.
16 It is burned with fire, cut down. They perish at the rebuke of your face.
17 Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son of humankind whom you made strong for yourself.
18 Then we will not turn back from you. Restore us to life, and we will proclaim your name.
19 O Yahweh God of hosts, restore us; cause your face to shine that we may be saved.
