1 I call on you, O Yahweh; hasten to me. Listen to my voice when I call to you.
2 Let my prayer be set before you as incense, the lifting up of my palms as the evening offering.
3 Set a guard, O Yahweh, over my mouth; keep watch over the door of my lips.
4 Do not incline my heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked deeds with men who do iniquity; and do not let me eat of their delicacies.
5 Let a righteous one strike me in kindness, and let him chasten me. It is oil for my head; let not my head refuse. For still my prayer is against their evil deeds.
6 When their judges are thrown down the sides of a cliff, then they will understand that my words were pleasant.
7 As when one plows and breaks up the earth, so our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
8 But my eyes are toward you, O Yahweh, my Lord; I have taken refuge in you. Do not lay bare my soul.
9 Protect me from the grasp of the trap they have laid for me, and from the snares of evildoers.
10 Let the wicked fall into their nets, while I escape altogether.
