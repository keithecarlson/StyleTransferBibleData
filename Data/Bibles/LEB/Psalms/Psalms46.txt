1 God is our refuge and strength, a very sufficient help in troubles.
2 Therefore we will not fear though the earth change, and though the mountains totter into the midst of the sea,
3 though its waters roar and foam, though mountains shake with its surging water. Selah
4 There is a river whose streams gladden the city of God, the holiest of the dwellings of the Most High.
5 God is in the midst of her; she will not be made to totter. God will help her at daybreak.
6 Nations roar, kingdoms shake; he utters his voice, the earth melts.
7 Yahweh of hosts is with us; our high stronghold is the God of Jacob. Selah
8 Come, see the works of Yahweh, who has placed desolations on the earth.
9 He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth; he breaks the bow and cuts off the spear. The wagons of war he burns with fire.
10 Be still, and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations; I will be exalted in the earth.
11 Yahweh of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our high stronghold.
