1 As a deer longs for streams of water, so my soul longs for you, O God.
2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God?
3 My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"
4 These I remember and I pour out my soul within me: that I would go with the multitude; I led them in procession to the house of God, with a voice of rejoicing and thanksgiving, a crowd celebrating a festival.
5 Why are you in despair, O my soul, and disturbed within me? Hope in God, because I will again praise him, for the salvation of his presence.
6 O my God, within me my soul is in despair; therefore I remember you from the land of Jordan and the heights of Hermon, from the mountain of Mizar.
7 Deep is calling to deep at the thunder of your waterfalls. All your breakers and your waves have passed over me.
8 By day Yahweh commands his loyal love, and in the night his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life.
9 I say to God, my rock, "Why have you forgotten me? Why must I walk about mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?"
10 As with a shattering in my bones my oppressors taunt me, while they say to me all day, "Where is your God?"
11 Why are you in despair, O my soul? And why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God, because I shall again praise him, my salvation and my God.
