1 May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble. May the name of Jacob's God protect you.
2 May he send you help from the sanctuary, and from Zion may he sustain you.
3 May he remember all your offerings, and your burnt offering may he regard favorably.
4 May he give to you your heart's desire, and your every plan may he fulfill. Selah
5 May we shout for joy over your victory, and in the name of our God may we set up banners. May Yahweh fulfill all your requests.
6 Now I know that Yahweh will help his anointed. He will answer him from his holy heaven with the victorious power of his right hand.
7 Some boast in chariots and others in horses, but we boast in the name of Yahweh, our God.
8 They will collapse and fall, and we will rise and stand firm.
9 Rescue, O Yahweh. Let the king answer us when we call.
