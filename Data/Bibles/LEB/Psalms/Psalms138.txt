1 I give you thanks with my whole heart; before the gods I sing your praise.
2 I bow down toward your holy temple and give thanks to your name, because of your loyal love and faithfulness, for you have magnified your word according to all your name.
3 When I called and you answered me, you emboldened me in my soul with strength.
4 All the kings of the earth will praise you, O Yahweh, when they have heard the words of your mouth,
5 and they will sing of the ways of Yahweh, because Yahweh's glory is great.
6 Though Yahweh is high, yet he sees the lowly, but the proud he perceives at a distance.
7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you preserve me alive. You stretch out your hand against the anger of my enemies, and you save me with your right hand.
8 Yahweh accomplishes things for my benefit. O Yahweh, your loyal love endures forever; do not abandon the works of your hands.
