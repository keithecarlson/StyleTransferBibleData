1 Rescue me, O Yahweh, from evil men. Preserve me from violent men,
2 who plan evil things in their heart. They stir up wars continually.
3 They sharpen their tongue as sharp as a snake's; the venom of a viper is under their lips. Selah
4 Protect me, O Yahweh, from the hands of the wicked. Preserve me from violent men, who have planned to make me stumble.
5 The proud have hidden a trap for me, and cords. They have spread out a net along the side of the path. They have set snares for me. Selah
6 I say to Yahweh, "You are my God." Listen, O Yahweh, to the voice of my supplications.
7 O Yahweh, my Lord, the strength of my salvation, you have covered my head in the day of battle.
8 Do not grant, O Yahweh, the desires of the wicked. Do not allow them to attain their plan, lest they be exalted. Selah
9 With respect to the head of those who surround me, may the harm of their lips cover them.
10 Let burning coals fall on them; let them be dropped into the fire, into bottomless pits from which they cannot rise.
11 Do not let a slanderer be established in the land; as for the man of violence, let evil hunt him quickly.
12 I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and justice for the needy.
13 Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name; the upright will dwell in your presence.
