1 A declaration of Yahweh to my lord, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool."
2 Yahweh will send out your mighty scepter from Zion; rule in the midst of your enemies.
3 Your people will volunteer in the day of your power. In holy splendor, from the womb of the dawn, you will have the dew of your youth.
4 Yahweh has sworn and he will not change his mind, "You are a priest forever according to the manner of Melchizedek."
5 O Lord, at your right hand he will shatter kings in the day of his anger.
6 He will judge among the nations; he will fill them with corpses. He will shatter the rulers of many countries.
7 He will drink from the stream by the road; therefore he will lift up his head.
