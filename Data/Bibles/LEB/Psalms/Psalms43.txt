1 Judge me, O God, and plead my case against an unfaithful nation. From a man of deceit and wickedness rescue me,
2 because you are the God of my refuge. Why have you rejected me? Why must I go about mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
3 Send your light and your truth; they shall lead me. They shall bring me to your holy mountain and to your dwelling places.
4 Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my surpassing joy, and I will praise you with lyre, O God, my God.
5 Why are you in despair, O my soul? And why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God, because I will again praise him, my salvation and my God.
