1 Shout out to God our strength; shout joyfully to the God of Jacob.
2 Lift up a song and strike the tambourine, the pleasant lyre, together with the harp.
3 Blow the horn at new moon, at full moon, for our feast day,
4 because it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
5 He made it a statute in Joseph when he went out against the land of Egypt, where I heard a language I did not know.
6 "I removed his shoulder from a burden. His hands were freed from the basket.
7 In this trouble you called, and I rescued you. Within the secret place of thunder I answered you; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah
8 Hear, O my people, and I will admonish you; O Israel, if you would but listen to me.
9 There shall be no strange god among you, and you shall not bow down to a foreign god.
10 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt. Open wide your mouth and I will fill it.
11 But my people did not listen to my voice, and Israel did not yield to me.
12 So I let them go in the stubbornness of their heart; they walked in their counsels.
13 Oh that my people would listen to me; that Israel would walk in my ways.
14 I would subdue their enemies quickly, and turn my hand against their adversaries.
15 Those who hate Yahweh would cringe before him, and their fate would be forever.
16 But he would feed him from the choicest wheat, and I would satisfy you with honey from a rock."
