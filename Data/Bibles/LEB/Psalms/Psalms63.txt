1 O God, you are my God; I will seek you diligently. My soul thirsts for you; my flesh longs for you as in a dry and weary land without water.
2 Thus I have seen you in the sanctuary, beholding your strength and glory.
3 Because your loyal love is better than life, my lips will praise you.
4 So I will bless you while I live. I will lift up my hands in your name.
5 My soul will be satisfied as with the best and richest food, and with joyful lips my mouth will praise.
6 When I remember you on my bed, I meditate on you in the night watches.
7 Because you have been my help, therefore in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy.
8 My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me.
9 But as for them who seek my life for ruin, they will go into the depths of the earth.
10 They who would deliver him to the sword will become a portion for jackals.
11 However, the king will rejoice in God. Everyone who swears an oath by him will boast, because the mouth of the liars will be stopped.
