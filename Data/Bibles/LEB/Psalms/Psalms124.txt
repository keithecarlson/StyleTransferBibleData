1 "If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side," do let Israel say,
2 "If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, when men rose up against us,
3 then they would have swallowed us alive, when their anger was kindled against us.
4 Then the waters would have flooded over us, the torrent would have passed over our soul.
5 Then over our soul would have passed the raging waters."
6 Blessed be Yahweh, who has not made us prey for their teeth.
7 Our soul has escaped like a bird from the snare of fowlers. The snare is broken, and we have escaped.
8 Our help is in the name of Yahweh, maker of heaven and earth.
