1 Be gracious to me, O God, be gracious to me, because in you my soul takes refuge. In the shadow of your wings I will take refuge until destruction passes by.
2 I will call to God Most High, to God who accomplishes things concerning me.
3 He will send from heaven and save me; he will reproach the one who tramples me. Selah God will send his loyal love and his faithfulness.
4 My soul is among lions. I lie down among those who devour— the children of humankind whose teeth are spears and arrows and whose tongues are sharp swords.
5 Be exalted above the heavens, O God. Let your glory be above all the earth.
6 They have set a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down. They have dug a pit before me; they have fallen into the midst of it. Selah
7 My heart is steadfast, O God; My heart is steadfast. I will sing and give praise.
8 Awake, my glory; Awake, harp and lyre. I will awake the dawn.
9 I will give you thanks among the peoples, O Lord; I will give you praise among the nations.
10 Because your loyal love is high to the heavens, and your faithfulness to the clouds.
11 Be exalted above the heavens, O God. Let your glory be above all the earth.
