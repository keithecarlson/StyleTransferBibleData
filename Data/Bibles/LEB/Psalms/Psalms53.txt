1 The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt and they have done abominable iniquity. There is none who does good.
2 God looks down from heaven upon the children of humankind to see whether there is one who has insight, one who seeks God.
3 All of them have turned back. They are altogether corrupt. There is none who does good; there is not even one.
4 Do not evildoers know, they who eat my people as though they were eating bread? They do not call on God.
5 There they are very fearful where no fear had been, because God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you. You have put them to shame, because God has rejected them.
6 Oh, that from Zion would come salvation for Israel! When God returns the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
