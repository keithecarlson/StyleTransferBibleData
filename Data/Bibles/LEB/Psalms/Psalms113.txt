1 Praise Yah! Praise, O servants of Yahweh, praise the name of Yahweh.
2 Let the name of Yahweh be blessed, from now until forever.
3 From the rising of the sun to its setting, let the name of Yahweh be blessed.
4 Yahweh is high above all nations; his glory is above the heavens.
5 Who is like Yahweh our God, who is enthroned on high,
6 who condescends to look at what is in the heavens and in the earth?
7 He raises the helpless from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap,
8 to seat them with princes, with the princes of his people.
9 He causes the barren woman of the house to dwell as the happy mother of children. Praise Yah!
