1 When I call, answer me, O God of my righteousness. In trouble deliver me. Be gracious to me and hear my prayer.
2 O sons of man, how long will my honor be a disgrace? How long will you love vanity? How long will you seek lies? Selah
3 But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself the faithful one. Yahweh hears when I call to him.
4 Be disturbed but do not sin. Commune in your heart on your bed and be silent. Selah
5 Offer correct sacrifices, and trust in Yahweh.
6 Many are saying, "Who will show us something good?" Lift up over us the light of your face, O Yahweh.
7 You have put gladness in my heart more than when their grain and their wine abound.
8 In peace I will lie down and sleep at once, for you alone, O Yahweh, make me dwell safely.
