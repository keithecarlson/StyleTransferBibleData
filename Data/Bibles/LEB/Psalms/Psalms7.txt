1 O Yahweh, my God, in you I have taken refuge. Save me from all who pursue me, and deliver me.
2 Or else he will tear me apart like a lion, ripping to pieces, with none to deliver.
3 O Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, if there is wrong in my hands,
4 if I have repaid my ally with harm, or if I have plundered my enemy without cause,
5 let the enemy of my soul pursue, and overtake and trample my life into the ground, and lay my honor in the dust. Selah
6 Rise up, O Yahweh, in your anger, and lift yourself up against the wrath of my oppressors, and awake for me, since you have commanded judgment.
7 And let the assembly of peoples surround you, and over it return on high.
8 Yahweh judges the nations. O Yahweh, vindicate me according to my innocence and according to my integrity within me.
9 Let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous, and test the hearts and innermost being, O righteous God.
10 My shield is with God who saves the upright of heart.
11 God is a righteous judge, and a God who has indignation every day.
12 If he does not repent, he will sharpen his sword. He has bent his bow and he has strung it.
13 And he has prepared for him weapons of death. He has made his arrows fiery shafts.
14 See, he travails with evil. He is pregnant with trouble, and he gives birth to deception.
15 He makes a pit and digs it out, then falls in the trap he has made.
16 His trouble comes back on his head, and his violence comes down on his skull.
17 I will thank Yahweh according to his righteousness, and I will sing praise to the name of Yahweh, the Most High.
