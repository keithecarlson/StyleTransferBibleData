1 O Yahweh, the king will rejoice in your strength, and how greatly he will delight in your help.
2 You have given him the desire of his heart, and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah
3 For you meet him with blessings of good things. You set on his head a crown of fine gold.
4 He asked life from you; you gave it to him— length of days forever and ever.
5 His honor is great because of your help. Splendor and majesty you have bestowed upon him.
6 For you set on him blessings forever. You make him glad with the joy of your presence.
7 Because the king trusts Yahweh, and through the steadfast love of the Most High he shall not be moved.
8 Your hand will find all your enemies; your right hand will find those who hate you.
9 You will make them like your fiery furnace at the time of your appearance. Yahweh will swallow them in his wrath and fire will consume them.
10 You will destroy their offspring from the earth, and their descendants from among the children of humankind.
11 Though they have plotted evil against you, though they have planned a scheme, they will not prevail.
12 For you will turn them to flight; you will aim arrows on your bowstrings at their faces.
13 Be exalted, O Yahweh, in your strength, and we sing and praise your power.
