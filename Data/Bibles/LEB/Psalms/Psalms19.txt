1 The heavens are telling the glory of God, and the firmament proclaims the work of his hands.
2 Every day they pour forth speech, and every night they tell knowledge.
3 There is no speech and there are no words; their sound is inaudible.
4 Yet in all the world their line goes out, and their words to the end of the world. In them he has pitched a tent for the sun,
5 and it is like a bridegroom who comes out of his bridal chamber. It is glad like a strong man to run its course.
6 Its rising is from one end of the heavens and its circuit to the other end of them; and nothing is hidden from its heat.
7 The law of Yahweh is perfect, reviving life. The testimony of Yahweh is firm, making wise the simple.
8 The precepts of Yahweh are right, making the heart rejoice. The command of Yahweh is pure, enlightening the eyes.
9 The fear of Yahweh is pure, enduring forever. The ordinances of Yahweh are true; they are righteous altogether,
10 more desirable than gold, even much fine gold; and sweeter than honey, even honey in the comb.
11 Moreover, your servant is warned by them; in keeping them is great reward.
12 Who can perceive his errors? Acquit me from hidden faults.
13 Also, keep back your servant from arrogant sins; let them not rule over me. Then I shall be blameless, and I shall be innocent of great transgression.
14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your presence, O Yahweh, my rock and my redeemer.
