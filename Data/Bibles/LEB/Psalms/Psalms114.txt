1 When Israel went out from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of a strange language,
2 Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
3 The sea looked and fled; the Jordan turned back.
4 The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs.
5 What's with you, O sea, that you fled? O Jordan, that you turned back?
6 O mountains, that you skipped like rams? O hills, like lambs?
7 At the presence of the Lord writhe, O earth, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
8 who turned the rock into a pool of water, flinty stone into a spring of water.
