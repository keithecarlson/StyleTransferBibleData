1 Why are nations in tumult, and countries plotting in vain?
2 The kings of the earth establish themselves, and the rulers conspire together against Yahweh and his anointed:
3 "Let us tear off their bonds, and cast their cords from us!"
4 He who sits enthroned in the heavens laughs. The Lord derides them.
5 Then he speaks to them in his wrath, and in his fury he terrifies them:
6 "But as for me, I have set my king on Zion, my holy mountain."
7 I will tell the decree; Yahweh said to me: "You are my son; today I have begotten you.
8 Ask from me and I will make the nations your heritage, and your possession the ends of the earth.
9 You will break them with an iron rod. Like a potter's vessel you will shatter them."
10 So then, O kings, be wise. Be warned, O rulers of the earth.
11 Serve Yahweh with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
12 Kiss the Son lest he be angry and you perish on the way, for his anger burns quickly. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.
