1 Sing to Yahweh a new song, for he has done wonders. His right hand and his holy arm have secured his victory.
2 Yahweh has made known his salvation; to the eyes of the nations he has revealed his righteousness.
3 He has remembered his loyal love and his faithfulness to the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
4 Shout joyfully to Yahweh, all the earth. Be cheerful and sing for joy and sing praises.
5 Sing praises to Yahweh with lyre, with lyre and melodious sound.
6 With trumpets and sound of horn, shout joyfully before the king, Yahweh.
7 Let the sea with its fullness roar, the world and those who live in it.
8 Let the rivers clap their hands. Let the hills sing joyfully together
9 before Yahweh, for he is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness and the peoples with equity.
