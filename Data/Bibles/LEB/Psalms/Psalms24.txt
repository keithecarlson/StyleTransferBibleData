1 The earth is Yahweh's, with its fullness, the world and those who live in it,
2 because he has founded it on the seas, and has established it on the rivers.
3 Who may ascend the mountain of Yahweh? And who may stand in his holy place?
4 He who is innocent of hands and pure of heart, who does not lift up his soul to falseness, and does not swear deceitfully.
5 He will receive blessing from Yahweh, and justice from the God of his salvation.
6 Such is the sort of those who seek him, those who seek your face, even Jacob. Selah
7 Lift up your heads, O gates, and rise up, O ancient doorways, that the king of glory may enter.
8 Who is the king of glory? Yahweh, strong and mighty; Yahweh, mighty in war!
9 Lift up your heads, O gates, and lift up, O ancient doorways, that the king of glory may enter.
10 Who is the king of glory? Yahweh of hosts, He is the king of glory! Selah
