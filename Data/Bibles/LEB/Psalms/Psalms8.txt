1 Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth, who put your splendor above the heavens.
2 From the mouth of children and infants you have founded strength on account of your enemies, to silence the enemy and the avenger.
3 When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars which you set in place—
4 what is a human being that you think of him? and a child of humankind that you care for him?
5 And you made him a little lower than heavenly beings, and with glory and with majesty you crowned him.
6 You make him over the works of your hands; all things you have placed under his feet:
7 sheep and cattle, all of them, and also the wild animals of the field,
8 the birds of the sky and the fish of the sea, everything that passes along the paths of seas.
9 Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all of the earth!
