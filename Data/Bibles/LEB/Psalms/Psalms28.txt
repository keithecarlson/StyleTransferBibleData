1 To you, O Yahweh, I call. O my rock, do not be deaf to me. Or else, if you are silent to me, then I will become like those descending to the pit.
2 Hear the voice of my supplications when I cry to you for help, when I lift up my hands toward your holy inner sanctuary.
3 Do not drag me away with the wicked or with the workers of evil, who speak of peace with their neighbors, while evil is in their heart.
4 Give to them according to their work, even according to the evil of their deeds. Give to them according to the work of their hands; repay them their rightful due.
5 Because they do not regard the works of Yahweh, nor the work of his hands, he will destroy them and not rebuild them.
6 Blessed is Yahweh, because he has heard the voice of my supplications.
7 Yahweh is my strength and my shield. My heart trusts him and I am helped. So my heart rejoices, and with my song I will give thanks to him.
8 Yahweh is their strength, and he is the refuge for the salvation of his anointed one.
9 Save your people and bless your heritage. Shepherd them also and carry them always.
