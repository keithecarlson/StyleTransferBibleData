1 "Too often they have attacked me from my youth." Let Israel say,
2 "Too often they have attacked me from my youth, yet they have not prevailed against me.
3 On my back plowmen have plowed. They have made their furrows long."
4 Yahweh is righteous. He has cut the ropes of the wicked.
5 Let all be put to shame and repulsed who hate Zion.
6 Let them be like grass on the housetops, that withers before it grows up,
7 with which a reaper cannot fill his hand, nor the binder of sheaves his arms,
8 so that passersby do not say, "The blessing of Yahweh be upon you. We bless you in the name of Yahweh."
