1 Why do you boast about evil, O mighty man? The loyal love of God endures continually.
2 Your tongue plans destruction, like a sharp razor, working deceit.
3 You love evil more than good, a lie more than speaking what is right. Selah
4 You love all devouring words, O deceitful tongue,
5 but God will pull you down forever. He will snatch you and tear you away from your tent, and he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah
6 And the righteous will see and fear, and will laugh at him, saying,
7 "Look, the man who would not make God his refuge, but he trusted in the greatness of his wealth; he took refuge in his destructiveness."
8 But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God. I trust the loyal love of God forever and ever.
9 I will give thanks to you forever, because of what you have done, and I will wait on your name, because it is good, in the presence of your faithful ones.
