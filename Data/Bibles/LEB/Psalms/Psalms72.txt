1 O God, give your judgments to the king, and your righteousness to the king's son.
2 May he judge your people with righteousness, and your poor with justice.
3 Let the mountains yield prosperity for the people, and the hills in righteousness.
4 May he provide justice for the poor of the people, save the children of the needy, and crush the oppressor.
5 May he live long while the sun endures as long as the moon for all generations.
6 May he descend like rain on mown grass, like showers watering the earth.
7 May what is right blossom in his days and an abundance of peace, until the moon is no more.
8 And may he rule from sea up to sea, and from the River to the edges of the land.
9 Let the desert dwellers bow down before him, and his enemies lick the dust.
10 Let the kings of Tarshish and the islands bring tribute. Let the kings of Sheba and Seba present gifts,
11 and let all kings bow down to him. Let all nations serve him.
12 Indeed he will deliver the needy who is crying for help, and the afflicted who has no helper.
13 He will take pity on the helpless and needy, and the lives of the needy he will save.
14 From oppression and from violence he will redeem their lives, and their blood will be precious in his eyes.
15 So may he live, and may gold from Sheba be given to him, and may prayers be offered for him continually. May blessings be invoked for him all day long.
16 May there be an abundance of grain in the land even on the top of the mountains. May his crop sway like the trees of Lebanon, and may those from the city blossom like the grass of the earth.
17 May his name endure forever. May his name increase as long as the sun shines, and let them be blessed in him. Let all nations call him blessed.
18 Blessed be Yahweh God, the God of Israel, who alone does wonderful things.
19 And blessed be his glorious name forever, and may the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen and Amen.
20 The prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are completed.
