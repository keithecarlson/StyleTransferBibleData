5 He gives food to those who fear him; he remembers his covenant forever.
6 He has declared the power of his works for his people, by giving to them the inheritance of the nations.
7 The works of his hands are faithfulness and justice; all his precepts are reliable.
8 They are sustained forever and ever, done with faithfulness and uprightness.
9 He has sent redemption to his people; he has commanded his covenant forever; holy and fearful is his name.
10 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom; all who do them have a good understanding. His praise endures forever.
