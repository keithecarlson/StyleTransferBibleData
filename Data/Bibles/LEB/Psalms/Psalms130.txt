1 Out of the depths I call to you, O Yahweh.
2 "O Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
3 If you, O Yah, should keep track of iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?
4 But with you is forgiveness, so that you may be feared."
5 I await Yahweh; my soul awaits, and I wait for his word.
6 My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning. Yes, more than watchmen for the morning.
7 O Israel, wait for Yahweh. For with Yahweh there is loyal love, and with him there is abundant redemption.
8 And he will redeem Israel from all its iniquities.
