1 O Yahweh, who may reside in your tent? Who may dwell on your holy mountain?
2 He who walks blamelessly and does what is right. He who speaks honestly in his heart.
3 He does not slander with his tongue. He does not harm his friend, nor bring up a disgrace against his neighbor.
4 In his eyes a rejected one is contemptible, but he honors those who respect Yahweh. He takes an oath to his own injury and does not retract it.
5 He does not lend his money at interest, and does not take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken.
