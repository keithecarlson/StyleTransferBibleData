1 O Yahweh, remember with regard to David all his affliction.
2 How he swore to Yahweh, he vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
3 "I will not enter into the tent of my house, I will not go up to the couch of my bed,
4 I will give no sleep to my eyes, no slumber to my eyelids,
5 until I find a place for Yahweh, a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob."
6 Look, we heard of it in Ephrathah; we found her in the fields of Jaar.
7 Let us go to his dwelling places; Let us worship at his footstool.
8 Arise, O Yahweh, to your resting place, you and your mighty ark.
9 Let your priests clothe themselves with righteousness, and let your faithful sing for joy.
10 For the sake of your servant David, do not turn away the face of your anointed one.
11 Yahweh swore in truth to David; he will not turn back from it. "One from the fruit of your body I will set on your throne.
12 If your sons will heed my covenant and my testimonies that I will teach them, their sons also forever will sit on your throne."
13 For Yahweh has chosen Zion; he has desired it for his habitation.
14 "This is my resting place forever; here I will dwell, for I have desired it.
15 I will bless its provisions abundantly; I will satisfy its poor with bread.
16 I will also clothe its priests with salvation, and its faithful will shout exuberantly for joy.
17 There I will cause a horn to grow for David; I will set a lamp for my anointed one.
18 I will clothe his enemies with shame, but on him his crown will flourish."
