1 O Yahweh, do not rebuke me in your anger, and do not discipline me in your wrath.
2 Be gracious to me, O Yahweh, because I am feeble. Heal me, O Yahweh, for my bones are terrified.
3 My soul is also very terrified. But you, O Yahweh, how long?
4 Turn, O Yahweh; deliver my life. Save me for the sake of your steadfast love.
5 For there is no remembrance of you in death. In Sheol, who will give thanks to you?
6 I am weary with my groaning; I flood my bed every night. With my tears I drench my couch.
7 My eye wastes away because of vexation; it grows old because of all my oppressors.
8 Depart from me, all workers of evil, for Yahweh has heard the sound of my weeping.
9 Yahweh has heard my plea; Yahweh has accepted my prayer.
10 All my enemies shall be ashamed and shall be very terrified. They shall turn back; they shall suddenly be ashamed.
