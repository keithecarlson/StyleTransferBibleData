1 Incline, O Yahweh, your ear and answer me, because I am poor and needy.
2 Watch over my life because I am faithful. You are my God; save your servant. I am the one who trusts you.
3 Be gracious to me, O Lord, because I call to you all day long.
4 Make glad the soul of your servant, because I desire you, O Lord.
5 For you, O Lord, are good and forgiving, and abundant in loyal love for all who call to you.
6 Heed, O Yahweh, my prayer, and attend to the voice of my supplications.
7 In the day of my trouble I call to you, because you answer me.
8 There is none like you among the gods, O Lord, and there are no works like yours.
9 All the nations that you have made will come and bow down before you, O Lord, and glorify your name.
10 For you are great and doing wondrous things; you alone are God.
11 Teach me, O Yahweh, your way, that I may walk in your truth. Unite my heart to fear your name.
12 I will give you thanks, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and glorify your name forever,
13 because your loyal love is great toward me, and you will have delivered my life from Sheol below.
14 O God, arrogant men have risen up against me, even a gang of ruthless men seek my life, but they do not set you before them.
15 But you, O Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and faithfulness.
16 Turn to me and be gracious to me. Give your strength to your servant, and grant victory to the son of your maidservant.
17 Do a sign that benefits me, that those who hate me may see and be put to shame, because you, O Yahweh, have helped me and comforted me.
