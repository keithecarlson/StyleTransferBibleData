1 O Yahweh, hear my prayer; listen to my supplications. In your faithfulness answer me, and in your righteousness.
2 And do not enter into judgment with your servant, because no one alive is righteous before you.
3 For the enemy has pursued my soul; he has crushed my life to the ground. He has made me dwell in dark places like those long dead.
4 And so my spirit grows faint within me; my heart within me is desolate.
5 I remember the days of long ago; I meditate on all your doings. I muse on the labor of your hands.
6 I stretch out my hands to you; my soul longs for you like a dry land. Selah
7 Quickly answer me, O Yahweh; my spirit fails. Do not hide your face from me, or I will become like those descending to the pit.
8 Cause me to hear your loyal love in the morning, for I trust you. Cause me to know the way that I should go, for I lift up my soul to you.
9 Deliver me from my enemies, O Yahweh. I take refuge in you.
10 Teach me to do your will, for you are my God; your Spirit is good. Lead me onto level ground.
11 For your name's sake, O Yahweh, preserve my life; in your righteousness bring me out of trouble.
12 And in your loyal love destroy my enemies, and exterminate all the adversaries of my soul, for I am your servant.
