1 I will exalt you, my God, O king, and I will bless your name forever and ever.
2 Every day I will bless you and praise your name forever and ever.
3 Great is Yahweh, and very worthy of praise, and his greatness is unsearchable.
4 One generation will laud your works to another, and will declare your mighty deeds.
5 On the splendor of the glory of your majesty, and on your wonderful deeds, I will meditate.
6 And they will speak of the power of your awesome deeds, and I will tell of your greatness.
7 They will utter  the renown of your abundant goodness, and they will proclaim with joy your righteousness.
8 Yahweh is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in loyal love.
9 Yahweh is good to all, and his mercies are over all his works.
10 All your works will praise you, O Yahweh, and your faithful ones will bless you.
11 They will speak of the glory of your kingdom, and talk of your power,
12 to make known to the children of humankind his mighty deeds, and the glory of the majesty of his kingdom.
13 Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures throughout all generations.
14 Yahweh upholds all who are falling, and raises up all who are bowed down.
15 The eyes of all look hopefully to you, and you give them their food in due time,
16 opening your hand, and satisfying the desire of every living creature.
17 Yahweh is righteous in all his ways, and loyal in all his works.
18 Yahweh is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.
19 He fulfills the desire of those who fear him; he also hears their cry for help, and saves them.
20 Yahweh protects all those who love him, but all the wicked he will exterminate.
21 My mouth will speak the praise of Yahweh, and all flesh will bless his holy name forever and ever.
