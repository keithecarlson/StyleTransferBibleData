1 Praise Yah. Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in his mighty firmament.
2 Praise him for his mighty deeds; praise him according to the abundance of his greatness.
3 Praise him with blast of horn; praise him with harp and lyre.
4 Praise him with tambourine and dancing; praise him with strings and flute.
5 Praise him with sounding cymbals; praise him with clashing cymbals.
6 Every breathing thing, let it praise Yah. Praise Yah.
