1 Now the Spirit explicitly says that in the last times some will depart from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons, 
2 by the hypocrisy of liars, who are seared in their own conscience, 
3 who forbid marrying and insist on abstaining from foods that God created for sharing in with thankfulness by those who believe and who know the truth, 
4 because everything created by God is good and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thankfulness, 
5 for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer.
6 By teaching these things to the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, trained in the words of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed faithfully. 
7 But reject those worthless myths told by elderly women, and train yourself for godliness. 
8 For the training of the body is somewhat profitable, but godliness is profitable for everything, because it holds promise for the present life and for the life to come. 
9 The statement is trustworthy and deserving of complete acceptance. 
10 For to this end we labor and suffer reproach, because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of believers.
11 Command these things and teach them. 
12 Let no one look down on your youth, but be an example for the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity. 
13 Until I come, pay attention to the public reading, to exhortation, to teaching. 
14 Do not neglect the gift that is in you, that was granted to you through prophecy with the laying on of hands by the council of elders. 
15 Practice these things. Be diligent in these things, in order that your progress may be evident to everyone. 
16 Fix your attention on yourself and on your teaching. Continue in them, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.
