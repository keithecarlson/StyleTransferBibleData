1 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, 
2 "Speak to the Israelites, saying, 'When a woman becomes pregnant and she gives birth to a male, then she shall be unclean seven days—as in the time of her menstrual bleeding, she shall become unclean. 
3 And on the eighth day his foreskin's flesh shall be circumcised. 
4 And for thirty-three days she shall stay in the blood of her cleansing; she must not touch any holy object, and she may not come to the sanctuary until the fulfilling of the days of her cleansing. 
5 But if she gives birth to a female, then she shall be unclean for two weeks as in her menstruation, and for sixty-six days she shall stay through the blood of her cleansing. 
6 And at the fulfilling of the days of her cleansing, whether for a son or for a daughter, she must bring to the priest at the tent of assembly's entrance a yearling male lamb as a burnt offering and young dove or a turtledove as a sin offering. 
7 And the priest shall present it before Yahweh, and he shall make atonement for her, so that she shall be clean from the flow of her blood. This is the regulation of childbearing for the male or for the female. 
8 And if she cannot afford a sheep, then she shall take two turtledoves or two young doves—one as a burnt offering and one as a sin offering—and the priest shall make atonement for her, so that she shall be clean.'"
