1 And it happened that in the spring time of year, the time when kings go out to battle, Joab led the troops of the army and destroyed the land of the Ammonites. And he came and besieged Rabbah, but David remained in Jerusalem. And Joab struck Rabbah and destroyed it. 
2 And David took the crown of their king from his head and found it to weigh a talent of gold. And in it was a precious stone. Then it was placed upon the head of David. And he brought out the booty of the city, a large amount. 
3 And the people who were in it he brought out, and he set them to work with saws and iron implements and axes. Thus David did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David returned, and all the nation went with him.
4 And after this there arose a war in Gezer with the Philistines. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Sippai, one of the descendants of the Rephaim. And they were subdued. 
5 And again there was war with the Philistines. And Elhanan son of Jair struck down Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. 
6 And again there was war in Gath. And there was a very tall man there, and he had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in all. He himself was also a descendant of the Rephaim. 
7 And he taunted Israel, but Jehonathan son of Shimea, brother of David, struck him down. 
8 These were born to the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
