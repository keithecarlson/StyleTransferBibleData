1 Therefore I, your fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a sharer of the glory that is going to be revealed, exhort the elders among you: 
2 shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not by compulsion but willingly, in accordance with God, and not greedily but eagerly, 
3 and not as lording it over those under your care, but being examples for the flock. 
4 And when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.
5 In the same way, younger men, be subject to the elders, and all of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble. 
6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you at the right time, 
7 casting all your cares on him, because he cares for you.
8 Be sober; be on the alert. Your adversary the devil walks around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour. 
9 Resist him, steadfast in your faith, because you know the same kinds of sufferings are being accomplished by your community of believers in the world. 
10 And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered for a short time, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you. 
11 To him be the power forever and ever. Amen.
12 Through Silvanus, the faithful brother (as I consider him), I have written to you briefly to encourage you and to attest that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it. 
13 She who is in Babylon, chosen the same as you, greets you, and so does my son Mark. 
14 Greet one another with a loving kiss. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
