1 Remind them to be subject to the rulers and to the authorities, to obey, to be prepared for every good work, 
2 to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all courtesy to all people. 
3 For we also were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, enslaved to various desires and pleasures, spending our lives in wickedness and envy, despicable, hating one another. 
4 But when the kindness and love for mankind of God our Savior appeared, 
5 he saved us, not by deeds of righteousness that we have done, but because of his mercy, through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit, 
6 whom he poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 
7 so that, having been justified by his grace, we may become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
8 The saying is trustworthy, and I want you to insist concerning these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to engage in good deeds. These things are good and beneficial for people. 
9 But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and contentions and quarrels about the law, for they are useless and fruitless. 
10 Reject a divisive person after a first and second admonition, 
11 knowing that such a person is perverted and is sinning, being self-condemned.
12 When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make haste to come to me in Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. 
13 Diligently send on their way Zenas the lawyer and Apollos, so that they may lack nothing. 
14 But also our people must learn to engage in good deeds for necessary needs, so that they will not be unfruitful. 
15 All those with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with all of you.
