1 This is the third time I am coming to you. By the testimony of two or three witnesses every word will be established. 
2 I have already said when I was present the second time, and although I am absent now I also say in advance to those who sinned previously and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare anyone, 
3 since you are demanding proof that Christ, who is not weak toward you, but is powerful among you, is speaking in me. 
4 For indeed, he was crucified because of weakness, but he lives because of the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we will live together with him because of the power of God toward you.
5 Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith. Examine yourselves! Or do you not recognize regarding yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are unqualified? 
6 And I hope that you will recognize that we are not unqualified! 
7 Now we pray to God that you not do wrong in any way, not that we are seen as approved, but that you do what is good, even though we are seen as though unqualified. 
8 For we are not able to do anything against the truth, but rather only for the truth. 
9 For we rejoice whenever we are weak, but you are strong, and we pray for this: your maturity. 
10 Because of this, I am writing these things although I am absent, in order that when I am present I may not have to act severely according to the authority that the Lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down.
11 Finally, brothers, rejoice, be restored, be encouraged, be in agreement, be at peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you. 
12 Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the saints greet you. 
13 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.
