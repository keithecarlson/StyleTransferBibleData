1 Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Where has your beloved turned that we may seek him with you?
2 My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the garden bed of the spice, to pasture his flock and to gather lilies in the garden.
3 I belong to my beloved and he belongs to me; he pastures his flock among the lilies.
4 You are beautiful, my beloved, as Tirzah, lovely as Jerusalem, overwhelming as an army with banners.
5 Turn away your eyes from before me, for they overwhelm me. Your hair is like a flock of the goats that moves down from Gilead.
6 Your teeth are like a flock of the ewes that have come up from the washing, all of them bearing twins, and there is none bereaved among them.
7 Your cheeks behind your veil are like halves of a pomegranate.
8 Sixty queens there are, eighty concubines, and maidens beyond number.
9 My dove, she is the one; my perfect, she is the only one; she is the favorite of her mother who bore her. Maidens see her and consider her fortunate; queens and concubines praise her:
10 "Who is this that looks down like the dawn, beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun, overwhelming as an army with banners?"
11 I went down to the orchard of the walnut trees to look at the blossoms of the valley, to see whether the vines have sprouted, whether the pomegranates have blossomed.
12 I did not know my heart set me in a chariot of my princely people.
13  Turn, turn, O Shulammite! Turn, turn so that we may look upon you! Why do you look upon the Shulammite as at a dance of the two armies?
