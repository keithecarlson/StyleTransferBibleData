1 On my bed in the night, I sought him whom my heart loves. I sought him, but I did not find him.
2 Now I will arise, and I will go about in the city, in the streets and in the squares; I will seek him whom my heart loves. I sought him, but I did not find him.
3 The sentinels who go about in the city found me. "Have you seen the one whom my heart loves?"
4 Scarcely had I passed by them when I found him whom my heart loves. I held him and I would not let him go until I brought him to the house of my mother, into the bedroom chamber of she who conceived me.

11 Come out and look, O maidens of Zion, at King Solomon, at the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, on the day of the joy of his heart!
