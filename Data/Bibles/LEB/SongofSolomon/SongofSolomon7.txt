1 How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O royal princess! The curves of your thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a craftsman.
2 Your navel is a round wine-mixing bowl that does not lack mixed wine! Your belly is a heap of wheat encircled with lilies.
3 Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.
4 Your neck is like a tower of ivory; your eyes are pools in Heshbon at the gate of Beth Rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon looking out over Damascus.
5 Your head crowns you like Carmel; the flowing locks of your head are like purple tapestry; a king is held captive in the tresses!
6 How beautiful you are and how pleasant, O loved one in the delights!
7 Your stature is like the palm tree, and your breasts are like clusters.
8 I say, "I will climb up the palm tree; I will lay hold of its fruit clusters." Let your breasts be pleasing like clusters of the vine and the scent of your breath like the apples.
9 Your palate is like the best wine that goes down for my beloved, smoothly gliding over my lips and teeth.
10 I belong to my beloved, and he desires me!
11 Come, my beloved, let us go out to the countryside; let us spend the night in the villages.
12 Let us rise early to go to the vineyards; let us see whether the vine has budded, whether the grape blossom has opened, and whether the pomegranates are in bloom; there I will give my love to you.
13 The mandrakes give off their fragrance, and over our doorway is every kind of delicious fruit; both fresh and dried fruit I have stored up for you, O my beloved.
