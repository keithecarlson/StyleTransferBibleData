1 How I wish that you were my little brother, who nursed upon my mother's breasts! If I met you outside, I would kiss you, and no one would despise me!
2 I would surely bring you to the house of my mother, who would surely teach me; I would give you spiced wine to drink, the sweet wine of my pomegranates.
3 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me.
4 I adjure you, O maidens of Jerusalem, do not arouse or awaken love until it pleases!
5 Who is this coming up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened you; there your mother conceived you; there she who was in labor gave birth to you.
6 Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm; for love is strong as death; passion is fierce as Sheol; its flashes are flashes of fire; it is a blazing flame.
7 Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot sweep it away. If a man were to give all the wealth of his house for love, he would be utterly scorned.
8 We have a little sister, and she does not yet have any breasts. What should we do for our sister on the day when she is betrothed?
9 If she is a wall, we will adorn her with a turret of silver; but if she is a door, we will barricade her with boards of cedar.
10 I was a wall, and my breasts were like the towers, so my betrothed viewed me with great delight.
11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he entrusted his vineyard to the keepers; people paid a thousand silver pieces for its fruit.
12 My own "vineyard" belongs to me; the "thousand" are for you, O Solomon, and "two hundred" for those who tend its fruit.
13 O you who dwell in the garden, my companions are listening to your voice. Let me hear it!
14 Flee, my beloved! Be like a gazelle or a young stag upon the perfumed mountains!
