1  "For look! The day is about to come, burning like an oven, and all the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble. The coming day will consume them," says Yahweh of hosts. "It will not leave behind for them root or branch. 
2 But for you who revere my name, the sun of righteousness will rise, with healing in its wings, and you will go out and leap like fattened calves. 
3 You will trample down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I am going to act," says Yahweh of hosts.
4 "Remember the instruction of my servant Moses, which I commanded him at Horeb to all Israel, the rules and regulations. 
5 Look! I am going to send to you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and awesome day of Yahweh! 
6 And he will bring back the hearts of the fathers to the sons, and the hearts of the sons to their fathers, so that I will not come and strike the land with a ban."
