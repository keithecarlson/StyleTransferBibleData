1 And Jonah prayed to Yahweh his God from the belly of the fish 
2 and said, "I called from my distress to Yahweh, and he answered me; from the belly of Sheol I cried for help— you heard my voice.
3 And you threw me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the sea currents surrounded me; all your breakers and your surging waves passed over me.
4 And I said, 'I am banished from your sight; how will I continue to look on your holy temple?'
5 The waters encompassed me up to my neck; the deep surrounded me; seaweed was wrapped around my head.
6 I went down to the foundations of the mountains; the Underworld—its bars were around me forever. But you brought up my life from the pit, Yahweh my God.
7 When my life was ebbing away from me, I remembered Yahweh, and my prayer came to you, to your holy temple.
8 Those who worship vain idols forsake their loyal love.
9 But I, with a voice of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to you; I will fulfill what I have vowed. Deliverance belongs to Yahweh!"
10 And Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out on the dry land.
