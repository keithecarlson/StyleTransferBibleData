1 And this was greatly displeasing to Jonah, and he became furious. 
2 And he prayed to Yahweh and said, "O Yahweh, was this not what I said while I was in my homeland? Therefore I originally fled to Tarshish, because I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and having great steadfast love, and one who relents concerning calamity. 
3 And so then, Yahweh, please take my life from me, because for me death is better than life!" 
4 And Yahweh said, "Is it right for you to be angry?"
5 And Jonah went out from the city and sat down east of the city, and he made for himself a shelter there. And he sat under it in the shade, waiting to see what would happen with the city. 
6 And Yahweh God appointed a plant, and he made it grow up over Jonah to be a shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort. And Jonah was very glad about the plant. 
7 So God appointed a worm at daybreak the next day, and it attacked the plant, and it withered. 
8 And when the sun rose, God appointed a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah's head and he grew faint. And he asked that he could die and said, "My death is better than my life!" 
9 So God said to Jonah, "Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?" And he said, "It is right for me to be angry enough to die!"
10 But Yahweh said, "You are troubled about the plant, for which you did not labor nor cause it to grow. It grew up in a night and it perished in a night! 
11 And should I not be concerned about Nineveh, the great city, in which there are more than one hundred and twenty thousand people who do not know right from left, plus many animals?"
