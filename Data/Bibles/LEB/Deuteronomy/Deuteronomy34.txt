1 Then Moses went up from the desert plateau of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho, and Yahweh showed him all of the land, Gilead all the way up to Dan, 
2 and all of Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh and all of the land of Judah, up to the western sea, 
3 and the Negev and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palms, on up to Zoar. 
4 And Yahweh said to him, "This is the land that I swore to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob, saying, 'To your offspring I will give it.' I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not cross into it." 
5 Then Moses, the servant of Yahweh, died there in the land of Moab according to the command of Yahweh. 
6 And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth Peor. But until this day no one knows his burial site. 
7 Now Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died; his sight was not impaired and his vigor had not abated. 
8 And the Israelites wept concerning Moses thirty days; finally the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were completed.
9 Now Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom because Moses had placed his hands on him, and the Israelites listened to him, and they did as Yahweh had commanded Moses. 
10 And not again has a prophet arisen in Israel like Moses, whom Yahweh knew face to face, 
11 as far as all the signs and the wonders Yahweh sent him to do in the land of Egypt, against Pharaoh and all of his servants and against all of his land, 
12 and as far as all of the mighty deeds and as far as the great awesome wonders Moses did before the eyes of all Israel.
