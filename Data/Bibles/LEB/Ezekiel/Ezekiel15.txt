1 And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, 
2 "Son of man, how will the wood of the vine be better than any of the wood of the branch which is among the trees of the forest? 
3 Can wood be taken from it to make anything, or can they take a tent peg from it to hang on it any object? 
4 Look! It is given to the fire as fuel. The fire will consume two of its ends, and its middle will be charred. Is it useful for anything? 
5 Look! When it is in perfect condition, it will not be used for anything, how much less when the fire has consumed it and it is charred; and then can it be used again for anything? 
6 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Just like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest which I gave to the fire for fuel, so I have given the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
7 And I will set my face against them. From the fire they mayescape, but the fire will yet consume them, and they will know that I am Yahweh when I set my face against them. 
8 And I will make the land a desolation because they acted very unfaithfully!" declares the Lord Yahweh.
