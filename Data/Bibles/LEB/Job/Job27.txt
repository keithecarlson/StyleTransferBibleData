1 Then Job again took up his discourse and said,
2 "As God lives, he has removed my justice, and Shaddai has made my inner self bitter.
3 For as long as my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nose,
4 my lips surely will not speak falseness, and my tongue surely will not utter deceit.
5 Far be it from me that I would say that you are right; until I pass away, I will not put away from me my blamelessness.
6 I hold fast to my righteousness, and I will not let it go; my heart will not blame any of my days.
7 "Let my enemy be like the wicked and my opponent like the unrighteous,
8 for what is the hope of the godless when he cuts them off, when God takes away his life?
9 Will God hear his cry of distress when distress comes upon him?
10 Or, in Shaddai will he find delight? Will he call upon God at all times?
11 "I will teach you about God's hand; I will not conceal that which is with Shaddai.
12 Look, you all have seen, and why in the world have you become altogether vain?
13 "This is the portion of the wicked human being with God, and they receive from Shaddai the inheritance of the ruthless.
14 If their children multiply, it is for the sword, and his offspring do not have enough to eat.
15 Their survivors are buried through the plague, and their widows do not weep.
16 If he heaps up silver like the dust and fashions clothing like the clay,
17 he makes it ready, and the righteous will wear it, and the innocent will divide the silver.
18 "He builds his house like the moth, and like a booth that a watchman has made.
19 He goes to bed with wealth, but he will do so no more; he opens his eyes, and it is gone.
20 Terrors overtake him like the water; a storm wind carries him off in the night.
21 The east wind lifts him up, and he is gone, and it sweeps him away from his place.
22 And it hurls at him, and it has no compassion; he will quickly flee from its power.
23 It claps its hands over him, and it hisses at him from its place.
