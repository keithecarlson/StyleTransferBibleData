1 Then Job answered and said,
2 "How you have helped one who has no power! How you have assisted the arm that has no strength!
3 How you have advised one who has no wisdom! And what sound wisdom you have made known in abundance!
4 With whose help have you uttered words, and whose breath has come forth from you?
5 "The spirits of the dead tremble below the waters and their inhabitants.
6 Sheol is naked before him, and there is no covering for Abaddon.
7 He stretches out the north over emptiness; he hangs the earth over nothing.
8 He ties up the water in its clouds, and the cloud is not torn open beneath it.
9 He covers the face of the full moon; he spreads his cloud over it.
10 He has described a circle on the face of the water between light and darkness.
11 "The pillars of heaven tremble, and they are astounded at his rebuke.
12 By his power he stilled the sea, and by his understanding he struck down Rahab.
13 By his breath the heavens were made clear; his hand pierced the fleeing snake.
14 Look, these are the outer fringes of his ways, and how faint is the word that we hear of him! But who can understand the thunder of his power?"
