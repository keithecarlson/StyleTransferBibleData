1 Then Job answered and said,
2 "Even today my complaint is bitter; my hand is heavy in addition to my groaning.
3 O that I knew and that I might find him; O that I might come to his dwelling.
4 I would lay my case before him, and I would fill my mouth with arguments.
5 I want to know the words with which he would answer me, and I want to understand what he would say to me.
6 Would he contend with me in the greatness of his strength? No, but he himself would give heed to me.
7 There an upright person could reason with him, and I would be acquitted forever by my judge.
8 "When I go forward, he is not there, or backward, I cannot see him.
9 When he works on the left, I cannot perceive him; he turns to the right, but I cannot see him.
10 But he knows the way that I take; he tests me—I shall come out like gold.
11 My foot has held on to his steps; I have kept his way, and I have not turned aside.
12 From the commandment of his lips, indeed I have not departed; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily food.
13 "But he is alone, and who can dissuade him? And whatever he desires, indeed, he does it.
14 For he will carry out what he appoints for me, and many things like these are with him.
15 Therefore, I am horrified because of his presence; when I consider, I tremble because of him.
16 Indeed, God has made my heart faint, and Shaddai has terrified me.
17 Indeed, I have not been silenced because of darkness, and because of me he conceals thick darkness.
