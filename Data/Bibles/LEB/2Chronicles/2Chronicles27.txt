1 Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok. 
2 And he did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his father Uzziah had done—only he did not go into the temple of Yahweh. But the people still acted corruptly. 
3 He built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh, and he did much restoration on the wall of Ophel. 
4 And he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and he built forts and towers in the wooded places. 
5 Now he fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed against them. And the Ammonites gave to him in that year one hundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures of wheat and ten thousand measures of barley. This is what the Ammonites rendered to him, as well as in the second and third year. 
6 And Jotham strengthened himself, for he established his ways before Yahweh his God.
7 Now the remainder of the words of Jotham and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written upon the scroll of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
8 He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. 
9 And Jotham slept with his ancestors, and they buried him in the city of David. And his son Ahaz became king in his place.
