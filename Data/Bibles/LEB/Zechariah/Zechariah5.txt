1 I looked up again, and I saw, and look!—a flying scroll! 
2 And he asked me, "What are you seeing?" And I said, "I am seeing a flying scroll twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide." 
3 And he said to me, "This is the curse going out over the surface of the whole earth. For everyone who steals has gone unpunished according to it, and likewise everyone who swears falsely has gone unpunished according to it. 
4 'I have sent it out,' declares Yahweh of hosts, 'and it will go into the house of the thief and into the house of the one swearing falsely by my name, and it will spend the night in that house and will destroy it, with its timber and its stone.'"
5 And the angel who was speaking to me went out, and he said to me, "Please look up! See what this is going out." 
6 And I asked, "What is it?" And he said, "This is a basket going out. And he said, "This is their iniquity throughout all the earth. 
7 And look, the lead cover was lifted and a woman was sitting inside the basket. 
8 And he said, "This is Wickedness!" And he thrust her back down into the basket, and threw the lead cover on top of it. 
9 And I looked up and saw, and look!—two women coming forward, and the wind was in their wings, and they had wings like those of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between the earth and the sky. 
10 And I asked the angel who was talking to me, "Where are they taking the basket?" 
11 And he said to me, "To build for it a house in the land of Shinar, and when it is put in place, it will be placed there on its site."
