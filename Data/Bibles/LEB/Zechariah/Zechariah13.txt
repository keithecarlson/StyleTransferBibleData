1 "'On that day a well will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and from impurity. 
2 And then, on that day,' declares Yahweh of hosts, 'I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and also the prophets and the spirit of uncleanness I will banish from the land. 
3 And then, if anyone prophesies again, his father and his mother who bore him will say to him, "You shall not live, because you have spoken a lie in the name of Yahweh!" And his father and his mother who bore him will pierce him through when he prophesies. 
4 And then on that day, each of the prophets will be ashamed because of his vision when he was prophesying, and they will not put on a cloak of hair in order to deceive, 
5 but he will say, "I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the soil, for a man has acquired me since my youth." 
6 And someone shall say to him, "What are these wounds between your arms?" and he will say, "Those I have received in the house of the ones who love me."'"
7 "O sword, awake against my shepherd, against the man who is my associate," declares Yahweh of hosts. "Strike the shepherd, so that the sheep may be scattered, and I will turn my hand against the small ones.
8 And then in all the land," declares Yahweh, "two thirds will be cut off and perish, and one third will be left alive in it.
9 And I will bring the remaining third into the fire, and I will refine them like one refines silver, and I will test them like one tests gold. They will call my name, and I will answer them. I will say, 'They are my people,' and they will say, 'Yahweh is my God.'"
