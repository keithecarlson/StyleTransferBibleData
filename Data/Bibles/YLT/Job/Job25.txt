1 And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith: --
2 The rule and fear  with Him, Making peace in His high places.
3 Is their  number to His troops? And on whom ariseth not His light?
4 And what? is man righteous with God? And what? is he pure -- born of a woman?
5 Lo -- unto the moon, and it shineth not, And stars have not been pure in His eyes.
6 How much less man -- a grub, And the son of man -- a worm!
