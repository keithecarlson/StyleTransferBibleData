1 And Elihu answereth and saith: --
2 This hast thou reckoned for judgment: Thou hast said -- `My righteousness  more than God's?'
3 For thou sayest, `What doth it profit Thee! What do I profit from my sin?'
4 I return thee words, and thy friends with thee,
5 Behold attentively the heavens -- and see, And behold the clouds, They have been higher than thou.
6 If thou hast sinned, what dost thou against Him? And thy transgressions have been multiplied, What dost thou to Him?
7 If thou hast been righteous, What dost thou give to Him? Or what from thy hand doth He receive?
8 For a man like thyself  thy wickedness, And for a son of man thy righteousness.
9 Because of the multitude of oppressions They cause to cry out, They cry because of the arm of the mighty.
10 And none said, `Where  God my maker? Giving songs in the night,
11 Teaching us more than the beasts of the earth, Yea, than the fowl of the heavens He maketh us wiser.'
12 There they cry, and He doth not answer, Because of the pride of evil doers.
13 Surely vanity God doth not hear, And the Mighty doth not behold it.
14 Yea, though thou sayest thou dost not behold Him, Judgment  before Him, and stay for Him.
15 And, now, because there is not, He hath appointed His anger, And He hath not known in great extremity.
16 And Job  vanity doth open his mouth, Without knowledge words he multiplieth.
