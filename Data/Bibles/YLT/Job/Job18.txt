1 And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith: --
2 When do ye set an end to words? Consider ye, and afterwards do we speak.
3 Wherefore have we been reckoned as cattle? We have been defiled in your eyes!
4 (He is tearing himself in his anger.) For thy sake is earth forsaken? And removed is a rock from its place?
5 Also, the light of the wicked is extinguished. And there doth not shine a spark of his fire.
6 The light hath been dark in his tent, And his lamp over him is extinguished.
7 Straitened are the steps of his strength, And cast him down doth his own counsel.
8 For he is sent into a net by his own feet, And on a snare he doth walk habitually.
9 Seize on the heel doth a gin, Prevail over him do the designing.
10 Hidden in the earth is his cord, And his trap on the path.
11 Round about terrified him have terrors, And they have scattered him -- at his feet.
12 Hungry is his sorrow, And calamity is ready at his side.
13 It consumeth the parts of his skin, Consume his parts doth death's first-born.
14 Drawn from his tent is his confidence, And it causeth him to step to the king of terrors.
15 It dwelleth in his tent -- out of his provender, Scattered over his habitation is sulphur.
16 From beneath his roots are dried up, And from above cut off is his crop.
17 His memorial hath perished from the land, And he hath no name on the street.
18 They thrust him from light unto darkness, And from the habitable earth cast him out.
19 He hath no continuator, Nor successor among his people, And none is remaining in his dwellings.
20 At this day westerns have been astonished And easterns have taken fright.
21 Only these  tabernacles of the perverse, And this the place God hath not known.
