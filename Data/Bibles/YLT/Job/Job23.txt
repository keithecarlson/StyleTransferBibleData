1 And Job answereth and saith: --
2 Also -- to-day  my complaint bitter, My hand hath been heavy because of my sighing.
3 O that I had known -- and I find Him, I come in unto His seat,
4 I arrange before Him the cause, And my mouth fill  arguments.
5 I know the words He doth answer me, And understand what He saith to me.
6 In the abundance of power doth He strive with me? No! surely He putteth  in me.
7 There the upright doth reason with Him, And I escape for ever from my judge.
8 Lo, forward I go -- and He is not, And backward -- and I perceive him not.
9  the left in His working -- and I see not, He is covered  the right, and I behold not.
10 For He hath known the way with me, He hath tried me -- as gold I go forth.
11 On His step hath my foot laid hold, His way I have kept, and turn not aside,
12 The command of His lips, and I depart not. Above my allotted portion I have laid up The sayings of His mouth.
13 And He  in one , And who doth turn Him back? And His soul hath desired -- and He doth .
14 For He doth complete my portion, And many such things  with Him.
15 Therefore, from His presence I am troubled, I consider, and am afraid of Him.
16 And God hath made my heart soft, And the Mighty hath troubled me.
17 For I have not been cut off before darkness, And before me He covered thick darkness.
