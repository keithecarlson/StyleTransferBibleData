1 And Zophar the Naamathite answereth and saith: --
2 Is a multitude of words not answered? And is a man of lips justified?
3 Thy devices make men keep silent, Thou scornest, and none is causing blushing!
4 And thou sayest, `Pure  my discourse, And clean I have been in Thine eyes.'
5 And yet, O that God had spoken! And doth open His lips with thee.
6 And declare to thee secrets of wisdom, For counsel hath foldings. And know thou that God forgetteth for thee,  of thine iniquity.
7 By searching dost thou find out God? Unto perfection find out the Mighty One?
8 Heights of the heavens! -- what dost thou? Deeper than Sheol! -- what knowest thou?
9 Longer than earth  its measure, And broader than the sea.
10 If He pass on, and shut up, and assemble, Who then dost reverse it?
11 For he hath known men of vanity, And He seeth iniquity, And one doth not consider !
12 And empty man is bold, And the colt of a wild ass man is born.
13 If thou -- thou hast prepared thy heart, And hast spread out unto Him thy hands,
14 If iniquity  in thy hand, put it far off, And let not perverseness dwell in thy tents.
15 For then thou liftest up thy face from blemish, And thou hast been firm, and fearest not.
16 For thou dost forget misery, As waters passed away thou rememberest.
17 And above the noon doth age rise, Thou fliest -- as the morning thou art.
18 And thou hast trusted because their is hope, And searched -- in confidence thou liest down,
19 And thou hast rested, And none is causing trembling, And many have entreated thy face;
20 And the eyes of the wicked are consumed, And refuge hath perished from them, And their hope  a breathing out of soul!
