1 Lo, thou  fair, my friend, lo, thou  fair, Thine eyes  doves behind thy veil, Thy hair as a row of the goats That have shone from mount Gilead,
2 Thy teeth as a row of the shorn ones That have come up from the washing, For all of them are forming twins, And a bereaved one is not among them.
3 As a thread of scarlet  thy lips, And thy speech  comely, As the work of the pomegranate  thy temple behind thy veil,
4 As the tower of David  thy neck, built for an armoury, The chief of the shields are hung on it, All shields of the mighty.
5 Thy two breasts  as two fawns, Twins of a roe, that are feeding among lilies.
6 Till the day doth break forth, And the shadows have fled away, I will get me unto the mountain of myrrh, And unto the hill of frankincense.
7 Thou  all fair, my friend, And a blemish there is not in thee. Come from Lebanon, O spouse,
8 Come from Lebanon, come thou in. Look from the top of Amana, From the top of Shenir and Hermon, From the habitations of lions, From the mountains of leopards.
9 Thou hast emboldened me, my sister-spouse, Emboldened me with one of thine eyes, With one chain of thy neck.
10 How wonderful have been thy loves, my sister-spouse, How much better have been thy loves than wine, And the fragrance of thy perfumes than all spices.
11 Thy lips drop honey, O spouse, Honey and milk  under thy tongue, And the fragrance of thy garments  as the fragrance of Lebanon.
12 A garden shut up  my sister-spouse, A spring shut up -- a fountain sealed.
13 Thy shoots a paradise of pomegranates, With precious fruits,
14 Cypresses with nard -- nard and saffron, Cane and cinnamon, With all trees of frankincense, Myrrh and aloes, with all chief spices.
15 A fount of gardens, a well of living waters, And flowings from Lebanon!
16 Awake, O north wind, and come, O south, Cause my garden to breathe forth, its spices let flow, Let my beloved come to his garden, And eat its pleasant fruits!
