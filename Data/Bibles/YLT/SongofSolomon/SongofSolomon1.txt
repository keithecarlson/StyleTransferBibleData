1 The Song of Songs, that  Solomon's.
2 Let him kiss me with kisses of his mouth, For better  thy loves than wine.
3 For fragrance  thy perfumes good. Perfume emptied out -- thy name, Therefore have virgins loved thee!
4 Draw me: after thee we run, The king hath brought me into his inner chambers, We do joy and rejoice in thee, We mention thy loves more than wine, Uprightly they have loved thee!
5 Dark  I, and comely, daughters of Jerusalem, As tents of Kedar, as curtains of Solomon.
6 Fear me not, because I  very dark, Because the sun hath scorched me, The sons of my mother were angry with me, They made me keeper of the vineyards, My vineyard -- my own -- I have not kept.
7 Declare to me, thou whom my soul hath loved, Where thou delightest, Where thou liest down at noon, For why am I as one veiled, By the ranks of thy companions?
8 If thou knowest not, O fair among women, Get thee forth by the traces of the flock, And feed thy kids by the shepherds' dwellings!
9 To my joyous one in chariots of Pharaoh, I have compared thee, my friend,
10 Comely have been thy cheeks with garlands, Thy neck with chains.
11 Garlands of gold we do make for thee, With studs of silver!
12 While the king  in his circle, My spikenard hath given its fragrance.
13 A bundle of myrrh  my beloved to me, Between my breasts it lodgeth.
14 A cluster of cypress  my beloved to me, In the vineyards of En-Gedi!
15 Lo, thou  fair, my friend, Lo, thou  fair, thine eyes  doves!
16 Lo, thou  fair, my love, yea, pleasant, Yea, our couch  green,
17 The beams of our houses  cedars, Our rafters  firs, I  a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys!
