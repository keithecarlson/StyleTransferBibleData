1 And Jonah prayeth unto Jehovah his God from the bowels of the fish.
2 And he saith: I called, because of my distress, to Jehovah, And He doth answer me, From the belly of sheol I have cried, Thou hast heard my voice.
3 When Thou dost cast me  the deep, Into the heart of the seas, Then the flood doth compass me, All Thy breakers and Thy billows have passed over me.
4 And I -- I said: I have been cast out from before Thine eyes, (Yet I add to look unto Thy holy temple!)
5 Compassed me have waters unto the soul, The deep doth compass me, The weed is bound to my head.
6 To the cuttings of mountains I have come down, The earth, her bars  behind me to the age. And Thou bringest up from the pit my life, O Jehovah my God.
7 In the feebleness within me of my soul Jehovah I have remembered, And come in unto Thee doth my prayer, Unto Thy holy temple.
8 Those observing lying vanities their own mercy forsake.
9 And I -- with a voice of thanksgiving -- I sacrifice to Thee, That which I have vowed I complete, Salvation  of Jehovah.
10 And Jehovah saith to the fish, and it vomiteth out Jonah on the dry land.
