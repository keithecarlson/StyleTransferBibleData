1 This third time do I come unto you; on the mouth of two witnesses or three shall every saying be established;
2 I have said before, and I say  before, as being present, the second time, and being absent, now, do I write to those having sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare,
3 since a proof ye seek of the Christ speaking in me, who to you is not infirm, but is powerful in you,
4 for even if he was crucified from infirmity, yet he doth live from the power of God; for we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him from the power of God toward you.
5 Your ownselves try ye, if ye are in the faith; your ownselves prove ye; do ye not know your ownselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, if ye be not in some respect disapproved of?
6 and I hope that ye shall know that we -- we are not disapproved of;
7 and I pray before God that ye do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that ye may do that which is right, and we may be as disapproved;
8 for we are not able to do anything against the truth, but for the truth;
9 for we rejoice when we may be infirm, and ye may be powerful; and this also we pray for -- your perfection!
10 because of this, these things -- being absent -- I write, that being present, I may not treat  sharply, according to the authority that the Lord did give me for building up, and not for casting down.
11 Henceforth, brethren, rejoice; be made perfect, be comforted, be of the same mind, be at peace, and the God of the love and peace shall be with you;
12 salute one another in an holy kiss;
13 salute you do all the saints;
14 the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,  with you all! Amen.
