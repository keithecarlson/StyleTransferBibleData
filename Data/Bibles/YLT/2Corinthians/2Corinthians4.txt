1 Because of this, having this ministration, according as we did receive kindness, we do not faint,
2 but did renounce for ourselves the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor deceitfully using the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth recommending ourselves unto every conscience of men, before God;
3 and if also our good news is vailed, in those perishing it is vailed,
4 in whom the god of this age did blind the minds of the unbelieving, that there doth not shine forth to them the enlightening of the good news of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God;
5 for not ourselves do we preach, but Christ Jesus -- Lord, and ourselves your servants because of Jesus;
6 because [it is] God who said, Out of darkness light  to shine, who did shine in our hearts, for the enlightening of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
7 And we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us;
8 on every side being in tribulation, but not straitened; perplexed, but not in despair;
9 persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
10 at all times the dying of the Lord Jesus bearing about in the body, that the life also of Jesus in our body may be manifested,
11 for always are we who are living delivered up to death because of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our dying flesh,
12 so that, the death indeed in us doth work, and the life in you.
13 And having the same spirit of the faith, according to that which hath been written, `I believed, therefore I did speak;' we also do believe, therefore also do we speak;
14 knowing that He who did raise up the Lord Jesus, us also through Jesus shall raise up, and shall present with you,
15 for the all things  because of you, that the grace having been multiplied, because of the thanksgiving of the more, may abound to the glory of God;
16 wherefore, we faint not, but if also our outward man doth decay, yet the inward is renewed day by day;
17 for the momentary light matter of our tribulation, more and more exceedingly an age-during weight of glory doth work out for us --
18 we not looking to the things seen, but to the things not seen; for the things seen  temporary, but the things not seen  age-during.
