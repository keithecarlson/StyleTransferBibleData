1 And concerning the things sacrificed to idols, we have known that we all have knowledge: knowledge puffeth up, but love buildeth up;
2 and if any one doth think to know anything, he hath not yet known anything according as it behoveth  to know;
3 and if any one doth love God, this one hath been known by Him.
4 Concerning the eating then of the things sacrificed to idols, we have known that an idol  nothing in the world, and that there is no other God except one;
5 for even if there are those called gods, whether in heaven, whether upon earth -- as there are gods many and lords many --
6 yet to us  one God, the Father, of whom  the all things, and we to Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom  the all things, and we through Him;
7 but not in all men  the knowledge, and certain with conscience of the idol, till now, as a thing sacrificed to an idol do eat , and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
8 But victuals do not commend us to God, for neither if we may eat are we in advance; nor if we may not eat, are we behind;
9 but see, lest this privilege of yours may become a stumbling-block to the infirm,
10 for if any one may see thee that hast knowledge in an idol's temple reclining at meat -- shall not his conscience -- he being infirm -- be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed to idols,
11 and the brother who is infirm shall perish by thy knowledge, because of whom Christ died?
12 and thus sinning in regard to the brethren, and smiting their weak conscience -- in regard to Christ ye sin;
13 wherefore, if victuals cause my brother to stumble, I may eat no flesh -- to the age -- that my brother I may not cause to stumble.
