1 And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
2 `See, I have called by name Bezaleel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,
3 and I fill him  the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all work,
4 to devise devices to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
5 and in graving of stone for settings, and in graving of wood to work in all work.
6 `And I, lo, I have given with him Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, and in the heart of every wise-hearted one I have given wisdom, and they have made all that which I have commanded thee.
7 `The tent of meeting, and the ark of testimony, and the mercy-seat which  on it, and all the vessels of the tent,
8 and the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick and all its vessels, and the altar of the perfume,
9 and the altar of the burnt-offering and all its vessels, and the laver and its base,
10 and the coloured garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, for acting as priests in;
11 and the anointing oil, and the perfume of the spices for the sanctuary; according to all that I have commanded thee -- they do.'
12 And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
13 `And thou, speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, Only, My sabbaths ye do keep, for it  a sign between Me and you, to your generations, to know that I, Jehovah, am sanctifying you;
14 and ye have kept the sabbath, for it  holy to you, he who is polluting it is certainly put to death -- for any who doeth work in it -- that person hath even been cut off from the midst of his people.
15 `Six days is work done, and in the seventh day  a sabbath of holy rest to Jehovah; any who doeth work in the sabbath-day is certainly put to death,
16 and the sons of Israel have observed the sabbath; to keep the sabbath to their generations  a covenant age-during,
17 between Me and the sons of Israel it  a sign -- to the age; for six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, and in the seventh day He hath ceased, and is refreshed.'
18 And He giveth unto Moses, when He finisheth speaking with him in mount Sinai, two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written by the finger of God.
