1 Paul, an apostle -- not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who did raise him out of the dead --
2 and all the brethren with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:
3 Grace to you, and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
4 who did give himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of the present evil age, according to the will of God even our Father,
5 to whom  the glory to the ages of the ages. Amen.
6 I wonder that ye are so quickly removed from Him who did call you in the grace of Christ to another good news;
7 that is not another, except there be certain who are troubling you, and wishing to pervert the good news of the Christ;
8 but even if we or a messenger out of heaven may proclaim good news to you different from what we did proclaim to you -- anathema let him be!
9 as we have said before, and now say again, If any one to you may proclaim good news different from what ye did receive -- anathema let him be!
10 for now men do I persuade, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if yet men I did please -- Christ's servant I should not be.
11 And I make known to you, brethren, the good news that were proclaimed by me, that it is not according to man,
12 for neither did I from man receive it, nor was I taught , but through a revelation of Jesus Christ,
13 for ye did hear of my behaviour once in Judaism, that exceedingly I was persecuting the assembly of God, and wasting it,
14 and I was advancing in Judaism above many equals in age in mine own race, being more abundantly zealous of my fathers' deliverances,
15 and when God was well pleased -- having separated me from the womb of my mother, and having called  through His grace --
16 to reveal His Son in me, that I might proclaim him good news among the nations, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood,
17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem unto those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus,
18 then, after three years I went up to Jerusalem to enquire about Peter, and remained with him fifteen days,
19 and other of the apostles I did not see, except James, the brother of the Lord.
20 And the things that I write to you, lo, before God -- I lie not;
21 then I came to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia,
22 and was unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea, that  in Christ,
23 and only they were hearing, that `he who is persecuting us then, doth now proclaim good news -- the faith that then he was wasting;'
24 and they were glorifying God in me.
