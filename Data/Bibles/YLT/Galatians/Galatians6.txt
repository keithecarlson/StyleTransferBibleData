1 Brethren, if a man also may be overtaken in any trespass, ye who  spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself -- lest thou also may be tempted;
2 of one another the burdens bear ye, and so fill up the law of the Christ,
3 for if any one doth think  to be something -- being nothing -- himself he doth deceive;
4 and his own work let each one prove, and then in regard to himself alone the glorying he shall have, and not in regard to the other,
5 for each one his own burden shall bear.
6 And let him who is instructed in the word share with him who is instructing -- in all good things.
7 Be not led astray; God is not mocked; for what a man may sow -- that also he shall reap,
8 because he who is sowing to his own flesh, of the flesh shall reap corruption; and he who is sowing to the Spirit, of the Spirit shall reap life age-during;
9 and in the doing good we may not be faint-hearted, for at the proper time we shall reap -- not desponding;
10 therefore, then, as we have opportunity, may we work the good to all, and especially unto those of the household of the faith.
11 Ye see in how large letters I have written to you with my own hand;
12 as many as are willing to make a good appearance in the flesh, these constrain you to be circumcised -- only that for the cross of the Christ they may not be persecuted,
13 for neither do those circumcised themselves keep the law, but they wish you to be circumcised, that in your flesh they may glory.
14 And for me, let it not be -- to glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which to me the world hath been crucified, and I to the world;
15 for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation;
16 and as many as by this rule do walk -- peace upon them, and kindness, and on the Israel of God!
17 Henceforth, let no one give me trouble, for I the scars of the Lord Jesus in my body do bear.
18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ  with your spirit, brethren! Amen.
