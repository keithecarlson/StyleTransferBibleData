1 A son of twenty and five years  Jotham in his reigning, and sixteen years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother  Jerushah daughter of Zadok.
2 And he doth that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that Uzziah his father did; only, he hath not come in unto the temple of Jehovah; and again are the people doing corruptly.
3 He hath built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah, and in the wall of Ophel he hath built abundantly;
4 and cities he hath built in the hill-country of Judah, and in the forests he hath built palaces and towers.
5 And he hath fought with the king of the sons of Ammon, and prevaileth over them, and the sons of Ammon give to him in that year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand cors of wheat, and of barley ten thousand; this have the sons of Ammon returned to him both in the second year, and in the third.
6 And Jotham doth strengthen himself, for he hath prepared his ways before Jehovah his God.
7 And the rest of the matters of Jotham, and all his battles, and his ways, lo, they are written on the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
8 A son of twenty and five years was he in his reigning, and sixteen years he hath reigned in Jerusalem;
9 and Jotham lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the city of David, and reign doth Ahaz his son in his stead.
