1 After these things hath the king Ahasuerus exalted Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and lifteth him up, and setteth his throne above all the heads who  with him,
2 and all servants of the king, who  in the gate of the king, are bowing and doing obeisance to Haman, for so hath the king commanded for him; and Mordecai doth not bow nor do obeisance.
3 And the servants of the king, who  in the gate of the king, say to Mordecai, `Wherefore  thou transgressing the command of the king?'
4 And it cometh to pass, in their speaking unto him, day by day, and he hath not hearkened unto them, that they declare  to Haman, to see whether the words of Mordecai do stand, for he hath declared to them that he  a Jew.
5 And Haman seeth that Mordecai is not bowing and doing obeisance to him, and Haman is full of fury,
6 and it is contemptible in his eyes to put forth a hand on Mordecai by himself, for they have declared to him the people of Mordecai, and Haman seeketh to destroy all the Jews who  in all the kingdom of Ahasuerus -- the people of Mordecai.
7 In the first month -- it  the month of Nisan -- in the twelfth year of the king Ahasuerus, hath one caused to fall Pur (that  the lot) before Haman, from day to day, and from month to month,  the twelfth, it  the month of Adar.
8 And Haman saith to the king Ahasuerus, `There is one people scattered and separated among the peoples, in all provinces of thy kingdom, and their laws  diverse from all people, and the laws of the king they are not doing, and for the king it is not profitable to suffer them;
9 if to the king [it be] good, let it be written to destroy them, and ten thousand talents of silver I weigh into the hands of those doing the work, to bring  in unto the treasuries of the king.'
10 And the king turneth aside his signet from off his hand, and giveth it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, adversary of the Jews;
11 and the king saith to Haman, `The silver is given to thee, and the people, to do with it as [it is] good in thine eyes.'
12 And scribes of the king are called, on the first month, on the thirteenth day of it, and it is written according to all that Haman hath commanded, unto lieutenants of the king, and unto the governors who  over province and province, and unto the heads of people and people, province and province, according to its writing, and people and people according to its tongue, in the name of the king Ahasuerus it hath been written and sealed with the signet of the king,
13 and letters to be sent by the hand of the runners unto all provinces of the king, to cut off, to slay, and to destroy all the Jews, from young even unto old, infant and women, on one day, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month -- it  the month of Adar -- and their spoil to seize,
14 a copy of the writing to be made law in every province and province is revealed to all the peoples, to be ready for this day.
15 The runners have gone forth, hastened by the word of the king, and the law hath been given in Shushan the palace, and the king and Haman have sat down to drink, and the city Shushan is perplexed.
