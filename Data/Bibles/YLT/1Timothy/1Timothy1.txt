1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to a command of God our Saviour, and of the Lord Jesus Christ our hope,
2 to Timotheus -- genuine child in faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord,
3 according as I did exhort thee to remain in Ephesus -- I going on to Macedonia -- that thou mightest charge certain not to teach any other thing,
4 nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, that cause questions rather than the building up of God that is in faith: --
5 And the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned,
6 from which certain, having swerved, did turn aside to vain discourse,
7 willing to be teachers of law, not understanding either the things they say, nor concerning what they asseverate,
8 and we have known that the law  good, if any one may use it lawfully;
9 having known this, that for a righteous man law is not set, but for lawless and insubordinate persons, ungodly and sinners, impious and profane, parricides and matricides, men-slayers,
10 whoremongers, sodomites, men-stealers, liars, perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that to sound doctrine is adverse,
11 according to the good news of the glory of the blessed God, with which I was entrusted.
12 And I give thanks to him who enabled me -- Christ Jesus our Lord -- that he did reckon me stedfast, having put  to the ministration,
13 who before was speaking evil, and persecuting, and insulting, but I found kindness, because, being ignorant, I did  in unbelief,
14 and exceedingly abound did the grace of our Lord, with faith and love that  in Christ Jesus:
15 stedfast  the word, and of all acceptation worthy, that Christ Jesus came to the world to save sinners -- first of whom I am;
16 but because of this I found kindness, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering, for a pattern of those about to believe on him to life age-during:
17 and to the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only wise God,  honour and glory -- to the ages of the ages! Amen.
18 This charge I commit to thee, child Timotheus, according to the prophesies that went before upon thee, that thou mayest war in them the good warfare,
19 having faith and a good conscience, which certain having thrust away, concerning the faith did make shipwreck,
20 of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I did deliver to the Adversary, that they might be instructed not to speak evil.
