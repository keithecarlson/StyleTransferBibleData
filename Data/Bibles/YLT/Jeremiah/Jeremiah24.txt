1 Jehovah hath shewed me, and lo, two baskets of figs, appointed before the temple of Jehovah, -- after the removing by Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, of Jeconiah, son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the heads of Judah, and the artizan, and the smith, from Jerusalem, when he bringeth them into Babylon --
2 In the one basket  figs very good, like the first-ripe figs, and in the other basket  figs very bad, that are not eaten for badness.
3 And Jehovah saith unto me, `What art thou seeing, Jeremiah?' and I say, `Figs, the good figs  very good, and the bad  very bad, that are not eaten for badness.'
4 And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying:
5 Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Like these good figs so do I acknowledge The removed of Judah -- that I sent from this place,  the land of the Chaldeans -- for good.
6 And I have set Mine eyes on them for good, And have brought them back to this land, And built them up, and I throw not down, And have planted them, and pluck not up.
7 And have given to them a heart to know Me, For I  Jehovah, And they have been to Me for a people, And I am to them for God, For they turned back unto Me with all their heart.
8 And like the bad figs, that are not eaten for badness, Surely thus said Jehovah: So do I make Zedekiah king of Judah, And his heads, and the remnant of Jerusalem, Who are left in this land, And who are dwelling in the land of Egypt,
9 And I have given them for a trembling, For evil -- to all kingdoms of the earth, For a reproach, and for a simile, For a byword, and for a reviling, In all the places whither I drive them.
10 And I have sent against them the sword, The famine and the pestilence, Till their consumption from off the ground, That I gave to them and to their fathers!
