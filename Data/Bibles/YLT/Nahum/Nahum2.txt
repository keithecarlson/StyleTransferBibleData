1 Come up hath a scatterer to thy face, Keep the bulwark, watch the way, Strengthen the loins, strengthen power mightily.
2 For turned back hath Jehovah to the excellency of Jacob, As  the excellency of Israel, For emptied them out have emptiers, And their branches they have marred.
3 The shield of his mighty ones is become red, Men of might [are in] scarlet, With fiery torches  the chariot in a day of his preparation, And the firs have been caused to tremble.
4 In out-places shine do the chariots, They go to and fro in broad places, Their appearances  like torches, As lightnings they run.
5 He doth remember his honourable ones, They stumble in their goings, They hasten  its wall, and prepared is the covering.
6 Gates of the rivers have been opened, And the palace is dissolved.
7 And it is established -- she hath removed, She hath been brought up, And her handmaids are leading as the voice of doves, Tabering on their hearts.
8 And Nineveh  as a pool of waters, From of old it  -- and they are fleeing! `Stand ye, stand;' and none is turning!
9 Seize ye silver, seize ye gold, And there is no end to the prepared things,  the abundance of all desirable vessels.
10 She is empty, yea, emptiness and waste, And the heart hath melted, And the knees have smitten together, And great pain  in all loins, And the faces of all of them have gathered paleness.
11 Where  the habitation of lionesses? And a feeding-place it  for young lions Where walked hath a lion, an old lion, A lion's whelp, and there is none troubling.
12 The lion is tearing parts  his whelps, And is strangling for his lionesses, And he doth fill  prey his holes, And his habitations  rapine.
13 Lo, I  against thee, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts, And I have burned in smoke its chariot, And thy young lions consume doth a sword, And I have cut off from the land thy prey, And not heard any more is the voice of thy messengers!
