1 And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying:
2 `Son of man, What is the vine-tree more than any tree? The vine-branch that hath been, Among trees of the forest?
3 Is wood taken from it to use for work? Do they take of it a pin to hang any vessel on it?
4 Lo, to the fire it hath been given for fuel, Its two ends hath the fire eaten, And its midst hath been scorched! Is it profitable for work?
5 Lo, in its being perfect it is not used for work, How much less, when fire hath eaten of it, And it is scorched, Hath it been used yet for work?
6 Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: As the vine-tree among trees of the forest, That I have given to the fire for fuel, So I have given the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
7 And I have set My face against them, From the fire they have gone forth, And the fire doth consume them, And ye have known that I  Jehovah, In My setting My face against them.
8 And I have made the land a desolation, Because they have committed a trespass, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah!'
