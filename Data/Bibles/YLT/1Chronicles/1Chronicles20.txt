1 And it cometh to pass, at the time of the turn of the year -- at the time of the going out of the messengers -- that Joab leadeth out the force of the host, and destroyeth the land of the sons of Ammon, and cometh in and beseigeth Rabbah -- David is abiding in Jerusalem -- and Joab smiteth Rabbah, and breaketh it down.
2 And David taketh the crown of their king from off his head, and findeth it  weight a talent of gold, and in it a precious stone, and it is on the head of David: and spoil of the city he hath brought out very much,
3 and the people who  in it he hath brought out, and setteth to the saw, and to cutting instruments of iron, and to axes; and thus doth David to all cities of the sons of Ammon, and David turneth back, and all the people, to Jerusalem.
4 And it cometh to pass, after this, that there remaineth war in Gezer with the Philistines, then hath Sibbechai the Hushathite smitten Sippai, of the children of the giant, and they are humbled.
5 And there is again war with the Philistines, and Elhanan son of Jair smiteth Lahmi, brother of Goliath the Gittite, the wood of whose spear  like a beam of weavers.
6 And there is again war in Gath, and there is a man of measure, and his fingers and his toes  six and six, twenty and four, and also, he hath been born to the giant.
7 And he reproacheth Israel, and smite him doth Jonathan son of Shimea, brother of David.
8 These were born to the giant in Gath, and they fall by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
