3 And David smiteth Hadarezer king of Zobah, at Hamath, in his going to establish his power by the river Phrat,

5 And Aram of Damascus cometh in to give help to Hadarezer king of Zobah, and David smiteth in Aram twenty and two thousand men,
6 and David putteth  in Aram of Damascus, and the Aramaeans are to David for servants, bearing a present, and Jehovah giveth salvation to David whithersoever he hath gone.
7 And David taketh the shields of gold that have been on the servants of Hadarezer, and bringeth them in to Jerusalem;

9 And Tou king of Hamath heareth that David hath smitten the whole force of Hadarezer king of Zobah,
10 and he sendeth Hadoram his son unto king David, to ask of him of peace, and to bless him (because that he hath fought against Hadarezer, and smiteth him, for a man of wars with Tou had Hadarezer been,) and all kinds of vessels, of gold, and silver, and brass;
