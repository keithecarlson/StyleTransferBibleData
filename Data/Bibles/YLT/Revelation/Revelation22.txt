1 And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, bright as crystal, going forth out of the throne of God and of the Lamb:
2 in the midst of its broad place, and of the river on this side and on that,  a tree of life, yielding twelve fruits, in each several month rendering its fruits, and the leaves of the tree  for the service of the nations;
3 and any curse there shall not be any more, and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall serve Him,
4 and they shall see His face, and His name  upon their foreheads,
5 and night shall not be there, and they have no need of a lamp and light of a sun, because the Lord God doth give them light, and they shall reign -- to the ages of the ages.
6 And he said to me, `These words  stedfast and true, and the Lord God of the holy prophets did send His messenger to shew to His servants the things that it behoveth to come quickly:
7 Lo, I come quickly; happy  he who is keeping the words of the prophecy of this scroll.'
8 And I, John, am he who is seeing these things and hearing, and when I heard and beheld, I fell down to bow before the feet of the messenger who is shewing me these things;
9 and he saith to me, `See -- not; for fellow-servant of thee am I, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of those keeping the words of this scroll; before God bow.'
10 And he saith to me, `Thou mayest not seal the words of the prophecy of this scroll, because the time is nigh;
11 he who is unrighteous -- let him be unrighteous still, and he who is filthy -- let him be filthy still, and he who is righteous -- let him be declared righteous still, and he who is sanctified -- let him be sanctified still:
12 And lo, I come quickly, and my reward  with me, to render to each as his work shall be;
13 I am the Alpha and the Omega -- the Beginning and End -- the First and the Last.
14 `Happy are those doing His commands that the authority shall be theirs unto the tree of the life, and by the gates they may enter into the city;
15 and without  the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the whoremongers, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and every one who is loving and is doing a lie.
