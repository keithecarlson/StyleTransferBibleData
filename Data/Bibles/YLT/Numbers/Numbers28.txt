1 And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
2 `Command the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, My offering, My bread for My fire-offerings, My sweet fragrance, ye take heed to bring near to Me in its appointed season.
3 `And thou hast said to them, This  the fire-offering which ye bring near to Jehovah: two lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones, daily, a continual burnt-offering;
4 the one lamb thou preparest in the morning, and the second lamb thou preparest between the evenings;
5 and a tenth of the ephah of flour for a present, mixed with beaten oil, a fourth of the hin;
6 a continual burnt-offering, which was made in mount Sinai, for sweet fragrance, a fire-offering to Jehovah;
7 and its libation, a fourth of the hin for the one lamb; in the sanctuary cause thou a libation of strong drink to be poured out to Jehovah.
8 `And the second lamb thou dost prepare between the evenings; as the present of the morning, and as its libation thou preparest -- a fire-offering, a sweet fragrance to Jehovah.
9 `And on the sabbath-day, two lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones, and two-tenth deals of flour, a present, mixed with oil, and its libation;
10 the burnt-offering of the sabbath in its sabbath, besides the continual burnt-offering and its libation.
11 `And in the beginnings of your months ye bring near a burnt-offering to Jehovah: two bullocks, sons of the herd, and one ram, seven lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones;
12 and three-tenth deals of flour, a present, mixed with oil, for the one bullock, and two-tenth deals of flour, a present, mixed with oil, for the one ram;
13 and a several tenth deal of flour, a present, mixed with oil, for the one lamb; a burnt-offering, a sweet fragrance, a fire-offering to Jehovah;
14 and their libations are a half of the hin to a bullock, and a third of the hin to a ram, and a fourth of the hin to a lamb, of wine; this  the burnt-offering of every month for the months of the year;
15 and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering to Jehovah; besides the continual burnt-offering it is prepared, and its libation.
16 `And in the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month,  the passover to Jehovah;
17 and in the fifteenth day of this month  a festival, seven days unleavened food is eaten;
18 in the first day  an holy convocation, ye do no servile work,
19 and ye have brought near a fire-offering, a burnt-offering to Jehovah: two bullocks, sons of the herd, and one ram, and seven lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones they are for you;
20 and their present, flour mixed with oil, three-tenth deals for a bullock, and two-tenth deals for a ram ye do prepare;
21 a several tenth deal thou preparest for the one lamb, for the seven lambs,
22 and one goat, a sin-offering, to make atonement for you.
23 `Apart from the burnt-offering of the morning, which  for the continual burnt-offering, ye prepare these;
24 according to these ye prepare daily, seven days, bread of a fire-offering, a sweet fragrance, to Jehovah; besides the continual burnt-offering it is prepared, and its libation;
25 and on the seventh day a holy convocation ye have, ye do no servile work.
26 `And in the day of the first-fruits, in your bringing near a new present to Jehovah, in your weeks, a holy convocation ye have; ye do no servile work;
27 and ye have brought near a burnt-offering for sweet fragrance to Jehovah: two bullocks, sons of the herd, one ram, seven lambs, sons of a year,
28 and their present, flour mixed with oil, three-tenth deals to the one bullock, two-tenth deals to the one ram,
29 a several tenth deal to the one lamb, for the seven lambs;
30 one kid of the goats to make atonement for you;
31 apart from the continual burnt-offering and its present ye prepare  (perfect ones they are for you) and their libations.
