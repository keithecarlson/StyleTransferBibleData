1 A Song of the Ascents. From depths I have called Thee, Jehovah.
2 Lord, hearken to my voice, Thine ears are attentive to the voice of my supplications.
3 If iniquities Thou dost observe, O Lord, who doth stand?
4 But with Thee  forgiveness, that Thou mayest be feared.
5 I hoped  Jehovah -- hoped hath my soul, And for His word I have waited.
6 My soul  for the Lord, More than those watching for morning, Watching for morning!
7 Israel doth wait on Jehovah, For with Jehovah  kindness, And abundant with Him  redemption.
8 And He doth redeem Israel from all his iniquities!
