1 A Secret Treasure of David. Preserve me, O God, for I did trust in Thee.
2 Thou hast said to Jehovah, `My Lord Thou ;' My good  not for thine own sake;
3 For the holy ones who  in the land, And the honourable, all my delight  in them.
4 Multiplied are their griefs,  have hastened backward; I pour not out their libations of blood, Nor do I take up their names on my lips.
5 Jehovah  the portion of my share, and of my cup, Thou -- Thou dost uphold my lot.
6 Lines have fallen to me in pleasant places, Yea, a beauteous inheritance  for me.
7 I bless Jehovah who hath counselled me; Also  the nights my reins instruct me.
8 I did place Jehovah before me continually, Because -- at my right hand I am not moved.
9 Therefore hath my heart been glad, And my honour doth rejoice, Also my flesh dwelleth confidently:
10 For Thou dost not leave my soul to Sheol, Nor givest thy saintly one to see corruption.
11 Thou causest me to know the path of life; Fulness of joys  with Thy presence, Pleasant things by Thy right hand for ever!
