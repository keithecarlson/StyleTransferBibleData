1 To the Overseer, by David. -- `To cause to remember.' O God, to deliver me, O Jehovah, for my help, haste.
2 Let them be ashamed and confounded Who are seeking my soul, Let them be turned backward and blush Who are desiring my evil.
3 Let them turn back because of their shame, Who are saying, `Aha, aha.'
4 Let all those seeking Thee joy and be glad in Thee, And let those loving Thy salvation Say continually, `God is magnified.'
5 And I  poor and needy, O God, haste to me, My help and my deliverer  Thou, O Jehovah, tarry Thou not!
