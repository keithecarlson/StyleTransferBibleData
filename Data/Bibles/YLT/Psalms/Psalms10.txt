1 Why, Jehovah, dost Thou stand at a distance? Thou dost hide in times of adversity,
2 Through the pride of the wicked, Is the poor inflamed, They are caught in devices that they devised.
3 Because the wicked hath boasted Of the desire of his soul, And a dishonest gainer he hath blessed, He hath despised Jehovah.
4 The wicked according to the height of his face, inquireth not. `God is not!'  all his devices.
5 Pain do his ways at all times, On high  Thy judgments before him, All his adversaries -- he puffeth at them.
6 He hath said in his heart, `I am not moved,' To generation and generation not in evil.
7 Of oaths his mouth is full, And deceits, and fraud: Under his tongue  perverseness and iniquity,
8 He doth sit in an ambush of the villages, In secret places he doth slay the innocent. His eyes for the afflicted watch secretly,
9 He lieth in wait in a secret place, as a lion in a covert. He lieth in wait to catch the poor, He catcheth the poor, drawing him into his net.
10 He is bruised -- he boweth down, Fallen by his mighty ones hath the afflicted.
11 He said in his heart, `God hath forgotten, He hath hid His face, He hath never seen.'
12 Arise, O Jehovah! O God, lift up Thy hand! Forget not the humble.
13 Wherefore hath the wicked despised God? He hath said in his heart, `It is not required.'
14 Thou hast seen, For Thou perverseness and anger beholdest; By giving into Thy hand, On Thee doth the afflicted leave , Of the fatherless Thou hast been an helper.
15 Break the arm of the wicked and the evil, Seek out his wickedness, find none;
16 Jehovah  king to the age, and for ever, The nations have perished out of His land!
17 The desire of the humble Thou hast heard, O Jehovah. Thou preparest their heart; Thou causest Thine ear to attend,
18 To judge the fatherless and bruised: He addeth no more to oppress -- man of the earth!
