1 A Song of the Ascents, by David. I have rejoiced in those saying to me, `To the house of Jehovah we go.'
2 Our feet have been standing in thy gates, O Jerusalem!
3 Jerusalem -- the builded one --  as a city that is joined to itself together.
4 For thither have tribes gone up, Tribes of Jah, companies of Israel, To give thanks to the name of Jehovah.
5 For there have sat thrones of judgment, Thrones of the house of David.
6 Ask ye the peace of Jerusalem, At rest are those loving thee.
7 Peace is in thy bulwark, rest in thy high places,
8 For the sake of my brethren and my companions, Let me speak, I pray thee, `Peace  in thee.'
9 For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God, I seek good for thee!
