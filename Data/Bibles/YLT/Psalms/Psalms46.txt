1 To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. `For the Virgins.' -- A song. God  to us a refuge and strength, A help in adversities found most surely.
2 Therefore we fear not in the changing of earth, And in the slipping of mountains Into the heart of the seas.
3 Roar -- troubled are its waters, Mountains they shake in its pride. Selah.
4 A river -- its rivulets rejoice the city of God, Thy holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.
5 God  in her midst -- she is not moved, God doth help her at the turn of the morn!
6 Troubled have been nations, Moved have been kingdoms, He hath given forth with His voice, earth melteth.
7 Jehovah of Hosts  with us, A tower for us  the God of Jacob. Selah.
8 Come ye, see the works of Jehovah, Who hath done astonishing things in the earth,
9 Causing wars to cease, Unto the end of the earth, the bow he shivereth, And the spear He hath cut asunder, Chariots he doth burn with fire.
10 Desist, and know that I  God, I am exalted among nations, I am exalted in the earth.
11 Jehovah of hosts  with us, A tower for us  the God of Jacob! Selah.
