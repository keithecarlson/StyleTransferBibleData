1 A Psalm of David. To Jehovah  the earth and its fulness, The world and the inhabitants in it.
2 For He on the seas hath founded it, And on the floods He doth establish it.
3 Who goeth up into the hill of Jehovah? And who riseth up in His holy place?
4 The clean of hands, and pure of heart, Who hath not lifted up to vanity his soul, Nor hath sworn to deceit.
5 He beareth away a blessing from Jehovah, Righteousness from the God of his salvation.
6 This  a generation of those seeking Him. Seeking Thy face, O Jacob! Selah.
7 Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in doth the king of glory!
8 Who  this -- `the king of glory?' Jehovah -- strong and mighty, Jehovah, the mighty in battle.
9 Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in doth the king of glory!
10 Who  He -- this `king of glory?' Jehovah of hosts -- He  the king of glory! Selah.
