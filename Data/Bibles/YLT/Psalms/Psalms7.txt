1 `The Erring One,' by David, that he sung to Jehovah concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite. O Jehovah, my God, in Thee I have trusted, Save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me.
2 Lest he tear as a lion my soul, Rending, and there is no deliverer.
3 O Jehovah, my God, if I have done this, If there is iniquity in my hands,
4 If I have done my well-wisher evil, And draw mine adversary without cause,
5 An enemy pursueth my soul, and overtaketh, And treadeth down to the earth my life, And my honour placeth in the dust. Selah.
6 Rise, O Jehovah, in Thine anger, Be lifted up at the wrath of mine adversaries, And awake Thou for me: Judgment Thou hast commanded:
7 And a company of peoples compass Thee, And over it on high turn Thou back,
8 Jehovah doth judge the peoples; Judge me, O Jehovah, According to my righteousness, And according to mine integrity on me,
9 Let, I pray Thee be ended the evil of the wicked, And establish Thou the righteous, And a trier of hearts and reins is the righteous God.
10 My shield  on God, Saviour of the upright in heart!
11 God  a righteous judge, And He is not angry at all times.
12 If  turn not, His sword he sharpeneth, His bow he hath trodden -- He prepareth it,
13 Yea, for him He hath prepared Instruments of death, His arrows for burning pursuers He maketh.
14 Lo, he travaileth  iniquity, And he hath conceived perverseness, And hath brought forth falsehood.
15 A pit he hath prepared, and he diggeth it, And he falleth into a ditch he maketh.
16 Return doth his perverseness on his head, And on his crown his violence cometh down.
17 I thank Jehovah, According to His righteousness, And praise the name of Jehovah Most High!
