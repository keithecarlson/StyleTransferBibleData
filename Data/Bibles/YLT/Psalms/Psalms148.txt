1 Praise ye Jah! Praise ye Jehovah from the heavens, Praise ye Him in high places.
2 Praise ye Him, all His messengers, Praise ye Him, all His hosts.
3 Praise ye Him, sun and moon, Praise ye Him, all stars of light.
4 Praise ye Him, heavens of heavens, And ye waters that are above the heavens.
5 They do praise the name of Jehovah, For He commanded, and they were created.
6 And He establisheth them for ever to the age, A statute He gave, and they pass not over.
7 Praise ye Jehovah from the earth, Dragons and all deeps,
8 Fire and hail, snow and vapour, Whirlwind doing His word;
9 The mountains and all heights, Fruit tree, and all cedars,
10 The wild beast, and all cattle, Creeping thing, and winged bird,
11 Kings of earth, and all peoples, Chiefs, and all judges of earth,
12 Young men, and also maidens, Aged men, with youths,
13 They praise the name of Jehovah, For His name alone hath been set on high, His honour  above earth and heavens.
14 And He exalteth the horn of His people, The praise of all His saints, Of the sons of Israel, a people near Him. Praise ye Jah!
