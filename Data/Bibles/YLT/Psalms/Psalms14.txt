1 To the Overseer. -- By David. A fool hath said in his heart, `God is not;' They have done corruptly, They have done abominable actions, There is not a doer of good.
2 Jehovah from the heavens Hath looked on the sons of men, To see if there is a wise one -- seeking God.
3 The whole have turned aside, Together they have been filthy: There is not a doer of good, not even one.
4 Have all working iniquity not known? Those consuming my people have eaten bread, Jehovah they have not called.
5 There they have feared a fear, For God  in the generation of the righteous.
6 The counsel of the poor ye cause to stink, Because Jehovah  his refuge.
7 `Who doth give from Zion the salvation of Israel? When Jehovah doth turn back  a captivity of His people, Jacob doth rejoice -- Israel is glad!
