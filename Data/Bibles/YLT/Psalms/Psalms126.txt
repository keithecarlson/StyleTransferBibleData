1 A Song of the Ascents. In Jehovah's turning back  the captivity of Zion, We have been as dreamers.
2 Then filled  laughter is our mouth, And our tongue  singing, Then do they say among nations, `Jehovah did great things with these.'
3 Jehovah did great things with us, We have been joyful.
4 Turn again, O Jehovah,  our captivity, As streams in the south.
5 Those sowing in tears, with singing do reap,
6 Whoso goeth on and weepeth, Bearing the basket of seed, Surely cometh in with singing, bearing his sheaves!
