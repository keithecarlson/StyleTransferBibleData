1 A Psalm of David. Jehovah  my shepherd, I do not lack,
2 In pastures of tender grass He causeth me to lie down, By quiet waters He doth lead me.
3 My soul He refresheth, He leadeth me in paths of righteousness, For His name's sake,
4 Also -- when I walk in a valley of death-shade, I fear no evil, for Thou  with me, Thy rod and Thy staff -- they comfort me.
5 Thou arrangest before me a table, Over-against my adversaries, Thou hast anointed with oil my head, My cup is full!
6 Only -- goodness and kindness pursue me, All the days of my life, And my dwelling  in the house of Jehovah, For a length of days!
