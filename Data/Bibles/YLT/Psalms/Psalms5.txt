1 To the Overseer, `Concerning the Inheritances.' -- A Psalm of David. My sayings hear, O Jehovah, Consider my meditation.
2 Be attentive to the voice of my cry, My king and my God, For unto Thee I pray habitually.
3 Jehovah,  morning Thou hearest my voice,  morning I set in array for Thee, And I look out.
4 For not a God desiring wickedness  Thou, Evil inhabiteth Thee not.
5 The boastful station not themselves before Thine eyes: Thou hast hated all working iniquity.
6 Thou destroyest those speaking lies, A man of blood and deceit Jehovah doth abominate.
7 And I, in the abundance of Thy kindness, I enter Thy house, I bow myself toward Thy holy temple in Thy fear.
8 O Jehovah, lead me in Thy righteousness, Because of those observing me, Make straight before me Thy way,
9 For there is no stability in their mouth. Their heart  mischiefs, An open grave  their throat, Their tongue they make smooth.
10 Declare them guilty, O God, Let them fall from their own counsels, In the abundance of their transgressions Drive them away, Because they have rebelled against Thee.
11 And rejoice do all trusting in Thee, To the age they sing, and Thou coverest them over, And those loving Thy name exult in Thee.
12 For Thou blessest the righteous, O Jehovah, As a buckler with favour dost compass him!
