1 Praise ye Jah! Praise ye the name of Jehovah, Praise, ye servants of Jehovah,
2 Who are standing in the house of Jehovah, In the courts of the house of our God.
3 Praise ye Jah! for Jehovah  good, Sing praise to His name, for [it is] pleasant.
4 For Jacob hath Jah chosen for Himself, Israel for His peculiar treasure.
5 For I have known that great  Jehovah, Yea, our Lord  above all gods.
6 All that Jehovah pleased He hath done, In the heavens and in earth, In the seas and all deep places,
7 Causing vapours to ascend from the end of the earth, Lightnings for the rain He hath made, Bringing forth wind from His treasures.
8 Who smote the first-born of Egypt, From man unto beast.
9 He sent tokens and wonders into thy midst, O Egypt, On Pharaoh and on all his servants.
10 Who smote many nations, and slew strong kings,
11 Even Sihon king of the Amorite, And Og king of Bashan, And all kingdoms of Canaan.
12 And He gave their land an inheritance, An inheritance to Israel His people,
13 O Jehovah, Thy name  to the age, O Jehovah, Thy memorial to all generations.
14 For Jehovah doth judge His people, And for His servants comforteth Himself.
15 The idols of the nations  silver and gold, Work of the hands of man.
16 A mouth they have, and they speak not, Eyes they have, and they see not,
17 Ears they have, and they give not ear, Nose -- there is no breath in their mouth!
18 Like them are their makers, Every one who is trusting in them.
19 O house of Israel, bless ye Jehovah, O house of Aaron, bless ye Jehovah,
20 O house of Levi, bless ye Jehovah, Those fearing Jehovah, bless ye Jehovah.
21 Blessed  Jehovah from Zion, Inhabiting Jerusalem -- praise ye Jah!
