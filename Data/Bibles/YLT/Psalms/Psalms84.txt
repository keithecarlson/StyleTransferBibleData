1 To the Overseer. -- `On the Gittith By sons of Korah.' -- A Psalm. How beloved Thy tabernacles, Jehovah of Hosts!
2 My soul desired, yea, it hath also been consumed, For the courts of Jehovah, My heart and my flesh cry aloud unto the living God,
3 (Even a sparrow hath found a house, And a swallow a nest for herself, Where she hath placed her brood,) Thine altars, O Jehovah of Hosts, My king and my God.
4 O the happiness of those inhabiting Thy house, Yet do they praise Thee. Selah.
5 O the happiness of a man whose strength is in Thee, Highways  in their heart.
6 Those passing through a valley of weeping, A fountain do make it, Blessings also cover the director.
7 They go from strength unto strength, He appeareth unto God in Zion.
8 O Jehovah, God of Hosts, hear my prayer, Give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.
9 Our shield, see, O God, And behold the face of Thine anointed,
10 For good  a day in Thy courts, O Teacher! I have chosen rather to be at the threshold, In the house of my God, Than to dwell in tents of wickedness.
11 For a sun and a shield  Jehovah God, Grace and honour doth Jehovah give. He withholdeth not good To those walking in uprightness.
12 Jehovah of Hosts! O the happiness of a man trusting in Thee.
