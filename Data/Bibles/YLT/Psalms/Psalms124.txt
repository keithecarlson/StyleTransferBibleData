1 A Song of the Ascents, by David. Save  Jehovah -- who hath been for us, (Pray, let Israel say),
2 Save  Jehovah -- who hath been for us, In the rising up of man against us,
3 Then alive they had swallowed us up, In the burning of their anger against us,
4 Then the waters had overflowed us, The stream passed over our soul,
5 Then passed over our soul had the proud waters.
6 Blessed  Jehovah who hath not given us, A prey to their teeth.
7 Our soul as a bird hath escaped from a snare of fowlers, The snare was broken, and we have escaped.
8 Our help  in the name of Jehovah, Maker of the heavens and earth!
