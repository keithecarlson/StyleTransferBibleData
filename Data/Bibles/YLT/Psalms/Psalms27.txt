1 By David. Jehovah  my light and my salvation, Whom do I fear? Jehovah  the strength of my life, Of whom am I afraid?
2 When evil doers come near to me to eat my flesh, My adversaries and mine enemies to me, They have stumbled and fallen.
3 Though a host doth encamp against me, My heart doth not fear, Though war riseth up against me, In this I  confident.
4 One  I asked of Jehovah -- it I seek. My dwelling in the house of Jehovah, All the days of my life, To look on the pleasantness of Jehovah, And to inquire in His temple.
5 For He hideth me in a tabernacle in the day of evil, He hideth me in a secret place of His tent, On a rock he raiseth me up.
6 And now, lifted up is my head, Above my enemies -- my surrounders, And I sacrifice in His tent sacrifices of shouting, I sing, yea, I sing praise to Jehovah.
7 Hear, O Jehovah, my voice -- I call, And favour me, and answer me.
8 To Thee said my heart `They sought my face, Thy face, O Jehovah, I seek.'
9 Hide not Thy face from me, Turn not aside in anger Thy servant, My help Thou hast been. Leave me not, nor forsake me, O God of my salvation.
10 When my father and my mother Have forsaken me, then doth Jehovah gather me.
11 Shew me, O Jehovah, Thy way, And lead me in a path of uprightness, For the sake of my beholders.
12 Give me not to the will of my adversaries, For risen against me have false witnesses, And they breathe out violence to me.
13 I had not believed to look on the goodness of Jehovah In the land of the living!
14 Look unto Jehovah -- be strong, And He doth strengthen thy heart, Yea, look unto Jehovah!
