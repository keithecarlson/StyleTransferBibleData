1 In the going out of Israel from Egypt, The house of Jacob from a strange people,
2 Judah became His sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
3 The sea hath seen, and fleeth, The Jordan turneth backward.
4 The mountains have skipped as rams, Heights as sons of a flock.
5 What -- to thee, O sea, that thou fleest? O Jordan, thou turnest back!
6 O mountains, ye skip as rams! O heights, as sons of a flock!
7 From before the Lord be afraid, O earth, From before the God of Jacob,
8 He is turning the rock to a pool of waters, The flint to a fountain of waters!
