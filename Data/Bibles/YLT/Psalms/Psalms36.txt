1 To the Overseer. -- By a servant of Jehovah, by David. The transgression of the wicked Is affirming within my heart, `Fear of God is not before his eyes,
2 For he made  smooth to himself in his eyes, To find his iniquity to be hated.
3 The words of his mouth  iniquity and deceit, He ceased to act prudently -- to do good.
4 Iniquity he deviseth on his bed, He stationeth himself on a way not good, Evil he doth not refuse.'
5 O Jehovah, in the heavens  Thy kindness, Thy faithfulness  unto the clouds.
6 Thy righteousness  as mountains of God, Thy judgments  a great deep. Man and beast Thou savest, O Jehovah.
7 How precious  Thy kindness, O God, And the sons of men In the shadow of Thy wings do trust.
8 They are filled from the fatness of Thy house, And the stream of Thy delights Thou dost cause them to drink.
9 For with Thee  a fountain of life, In Thy light we see light.
10 Draw out Thy kindness to those knowing Thee, And Thy righteousness to the upright of heart.
11 Let not a foot of pride meet me, And a hand of the wicked let not move me.
12 There have workers of iniquity fallen, They have been overthrown, And have not been able to arise!
