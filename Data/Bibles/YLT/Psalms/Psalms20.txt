1 To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. Jehovah doth answer thee, In a day of adversity, The name of the God of Jacob doth set thee on high,
2 He doth send thy help from the sanctuary, And from Zion doth support thee,
3 He doth remember all thy presents, And thy burnt-offering doth reduce to ashes. Selah.
4 He doth give to thee according to thy heart, And all thy counsel doth fulfil.
5 We sing of thy salvation, And in the name of our God set up a banner. Jehovah doth fulfil all thy requests.
6 Now I have known That Jehovah hath saved His anointed, He answereth him from His holy heavens, With the saving might of His right hand.
7 Some of chariots, and some of horses, And we of the name of Jehovah our God Make mention.
8 They -- they have bowed and have fallen, And we have risen and station ourselves upright.
9 O Jehovah, save the king, He doth answer us in the day we call!
