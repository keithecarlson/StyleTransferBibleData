1 To the Overseer. -- `On a disease.' -- An instruction, by David. A fool said in his heart, `There is no God.' They have done corruptly, Yea, they have done abominable iniquity, There is none doing good.
2 God from the heavens looked on the sons of men, To see if there be an understanding one,  seeking God.
3 Every one went back, together they became filthy, There is none doing good -- not even one.
4 Have not workers of iniquity known, Those eating my people have eaten bread, God they have not called.
5 There they feared a fear -- there was no fear, For God hath scattered the bones of him Who is encamping against thee, Thou hast put to shame, For God hath despised them.
6 Who doth give from Zion the salvation of Israel? When God turneth back  a captivity of His people, Jacob doth rejoice -- Israel is glad!
