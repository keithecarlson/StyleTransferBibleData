1 To the Overseer. -- By David. In Jehovah I trusted, how say ye to my soul, `They moved  Thy mountain for the bird?
2 For lo, the wicked tread a bow, They have prepared their arrow on the string, To shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
3 When the foundations are destroyed, The righteous -- what hath he done?
4 `Jehovah  in his holy temple: Jehovah -- in the heavens  His throne. His eyes see -- His eyelids try the sons of men.
5 Jehovah the righteous doth try. And the wicked and the lover of violence, Hath His soul hated,
6 He poureth on the wicked snares, fire, and brimstone, And a horrible wind  the portion of their cup.
7 For righteous  Jehovah, Righteousness He hath loved, The upright doth His countenance see!'
