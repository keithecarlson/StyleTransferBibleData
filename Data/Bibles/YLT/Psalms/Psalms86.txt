1 A Prayer of David. Incline, O Jehovah, Thine ear, Answer me, for I  poor and needy.
2 Keep my soul, for I  pious, Save Thy servant -- who is trusting to Thee, O Thou, my God.
3 Favour me, O Lord, for to Thee I call all the day.
4 Rejoice the soul of Thy servant, For unto Thee, O Lord, my soul I lift up.
5 For Thou, Lord,  good and forgiving. And abundant in kindness to all calling Thee.
6 Hear, O Jehovah, my prayer, And attend to the voice of my supplications.
7 In a day of my distress I call Thee, For Thou dost answer me.
8 There is none like Thee among the gods, O Lord, And like Thy works there are none.
9 All nations that Thou hast made Come and bow themselves before Thee, O Lord, And give honour to Thy name.
10 For great  Thou, and doing wonders, Thou  God Thyself alone.
11 Show me, O Jehovah, Thy way, I walk in Thy truth, My heart doth rejoice to fear Thy name.
12 I confess Thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, And I honour Thy name to the age.
13 For Thy kindness  great toward me, And Thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.
14 O God, the proud have risen up against me, And a company of the terrible sought my soul, And have not placed Thee before them,
15 And Thou, O Lord,  God, merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in kindness and truth.
16 Look unto me, and favour me, Give Thy strength to Thy servant, And give salvation to a son of Thine handmaid.
17 Do with me a sign for good, And those hating me see and are ashamed, For Thou, O Jehovah, hast helped me, Yea, Thou hast comforted me!
