1 To the Overseer, for Jeduthun. -- A Psalm of Asaph. My voice  to God, and I cry, my voice  to God, And He hath given ear unto me.
2 In a day of my distress the Lord I sought, My hand by night hath been spread out, And it doth not cease, My soul hath refused to be comforted.
3 I remember God, and make a noise, I meditate, and feeble is my spirit. Selah.
4 Thou hast taken hold of the watches of mine eyes, I have been moved, and I speak not.
5 I have reckoned the days of old, The years of the ages.
6 I remember my music in the night, With my heart I meditate, and my spirit doth search diligently:
7 To the ages doth the Lord cast off? Doth He add to be pleased no more?
8 Hath His kindness ceased for ever? The saying failed to all generations?
9 Hath God forgotten  favours? Hath He shut up in anger His mercies? Selah.
10 And I say: `My weakness is, The changes of the right hand of the Most High.'
11 I mention the doings of Jah, For I remember of old Thy wonders,
12 And I have meditated on all Thy working, And I talk concerning Thy doings.
13 O God, in holiness  Thy way, Who  a great god like God?
14 Thou  the God doing wonders. Thou hast made known among the peoples Thy strength,
15 Thou hast redeemed with strength Thy people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
16 The waters have seen Thee, O God, The waters have seen Thee, They are afraid -- also depths are troubled.
17 Poured out waters have thick clouds, The skies have given forth a noise, Also -- Thine arrows go up and down.
18 The voice of Thy thunder  in the spheres, Lightnings have lightened the world, The earth hath trembled, yea, it shaketh.
19 In the sea  Thy way, And Thy paths  in many waters, And Thy tracks have not been known.
20 Thou hast led as a flock Thy people, By the hand of Moses and Aaron!
