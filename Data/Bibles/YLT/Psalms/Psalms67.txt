1 To the Overseer, with stringed instruments. -- A Psalm, a Song. God doth favour us and bless us, Doth cause His face to shine with us. Selah.
2 For the knowledge in earth of Thy way, among all nations of Thy salvation.
3 Praise Thee do peoples, O God, Praise Thee do peoples, all of them.
4 Rejoice and sing do nations, For Thou judgest peoples uprightly, And peoples on earth comfortest. Selah.
5 Confess Thee do peoples, O God, Confess Thee do peoples -- all of them.
6 Earth hath given her increase, God doth bless us -- our God,
7 God doth bless us, and all ends of earth fear Him!
