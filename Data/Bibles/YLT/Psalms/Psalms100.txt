1 A Psalm of Thanksgiving. Shout to Jehovah, all the earth.
2 Serve Jehovah with joy, come before him with singing.
3 Know that Jehovah He  God, He made us, and we are His, His people -- and the flock of His pasture.
4 Enter ye His gates with thanksgiving, His courts with praise, Give ye thanks to Him, bless ye His Name.
5 For good  Jehovah, to the age His kindness, And to generation and generation His faithfulness!
