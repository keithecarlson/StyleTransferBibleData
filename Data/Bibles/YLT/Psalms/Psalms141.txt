1 A Psalm, by David. O Jehovah, I have called Thee, haste to me, Give ear  my voice when I call to Thee.
2 My prayer is prepared -- incense before Thee, The lifting up of my hands -- the evening present.
3 Set, O Jehovah, a watch for my mouth, Watch Thou over the door of my lips.
4 Incline not my heart to an evil thing, To do habitually actions in wickedness, With men working iniquity, Yea, I eat not of their pleasant things.
5 The righteous doth beat me  kindness. And doth reprove me, Oil of the head my head disalloweth not, For still my prayer  about their vexations.
6 Their judges have been released by the sides of a rock, And they have heard my sayings, For they have been pleasant.
7 As one tilling and ripping up in the land, Have our bones been scattered at the command of Saul.
8 But to Thee, O Jehovah, my Lord,  mine eyes, In Thee I have trusted, Make not bare my soul.
9 Keep me from the gin they laid for me, Even snares of workers of iniquity.
10 The wicked fall in their nets together, till I pass over!
