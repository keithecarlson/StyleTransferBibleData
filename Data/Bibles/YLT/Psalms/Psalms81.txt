1 To the Overseer. -- `On the Gittith.' By Asaph. Cry aloud to God our strength, Shout to the God of Jacob.
2 Lift up a song, and give out a timbrel, A pleasant harp with psaltery.
3 Blow in the month a trumpet, In the new moon, at the day of our festival,
4 For a statute to Israel it , An ordinance of the God of Jacob.
5 A testimony on Joseph He hath placed it, In his going forth over the land of Egypt. A lip, I have not known -- I hear.
6 From the burden his shoulder I turned aside, His hands from the basket pass over.
7 In distress thou hast called and I deliver thee, I answer thee in the secret place of thunder, I try thee by the waters of Meribah. Selah.
8 Hear, O My people, and I testify to thee, O Israel, if thou dost hearken to me:
9 There is not in thee a strange god, And thou bowest not thyself to a strange god.
10 I  Jehovah thy God, Who bringeth thee up out of the land of Egypt. Enlarge thy mouth, and I fill it.
11 But, My people hearkened not to My voice, And Israel hath not consented to Me.
12 And I send them away in the enmity of their heart, They walk in their own counsels.
13 O that My people were hearkening to Me, Israel in My ways would walk.
14 As a little thing their enemies I cause to bow, And against their adversaries I turn back My hand,
15 Those hating Jehovah feign obedience to Him, But their time is -- to the age.
16 He causeth him to eat of the fat of wheat, And  honey from a rock I satisfy thee!
