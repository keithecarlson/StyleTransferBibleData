1 To the Overseer with stringed instruments, on the octave. -- A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, in Thine anger reprove me not, Nor in Thy fury chastise me.
2 Favour me, O Jehovah, for I  weak, Heal me, O Jehovah, For troubled have been my bones,
3 And my soul hath been troubled greatly, And Thou, O Jehovah, till when?
4 Turn back, O Jehovah, draw out my soul, Save me for Thy kindness' sake.
5 For there is not in death Thy memorial, In Sheol, who doth give thanks to Thee?
6 I have been weary with my sighing, I meditate through all the night  my bed, With my tear my couch I waste.
7 Old from provocation is mine eye, It is old because of all mine adversaries,
8 Turn from me all ye workers of iniquity, For Jehovah heard the voice of my weeping,
9 Jehovah hath heard my supplication, Jehovah my prayer receiveth.
10 Ashamed and troubled greatly are all mine enemies, They turn back -- ashamed  a moment!
