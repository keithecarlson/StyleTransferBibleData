1 To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. A Psalm. All ye peoples, clap the hand, Shout to God with a voice of singing,
2 For Jehovah Most High  fearful, A great king over all the earth.
3 He leadeth peoples under us, and nations under our feet.
4 He doth choose for us our inheritance, The excellency of Jacob that He loves. Selah.
5 God hath gone up with a shout, Jehovah with the sound of a trumpet.
6 Praise God -- praise -- give praise to our king, praise.
7 For king of all the earth  God, Give praise, O understanding one.
8 God hath reigned over nations, God hath sat on His holy throne,
9 Nobles of peoples have been gathered,  the people of the God of Abraham, For to God  the shields of earth, Greatly hath He been exalted!
