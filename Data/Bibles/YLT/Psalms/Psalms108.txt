1 A Song, a Psalm of David. Prepared is my heart, O God, I sing, yea, I sing praise, also my honour.
2 Awake, psaltery and harp, I awake the dawn.
3 I thank Thee among peoples, O Jehovah, And I praise Thee among the nations.
4 For great above the heavens  Thy kindness, And unto the clouds Thy truth.
5 Be Thou exalted above the heavens, O God, And above all the earth Thy honour.
6 That Thy beloved ones may be delivered, Save  Thy right hand, and answer us.
7 God hath spoken in His holiness: I exult, I apportion Shechem, And the valley of Succoth I measure,
8 Mine  Gilead, mine  Manasseh, And Ephraim  the strength of my head, Judah  my lawgiver,
9 Moab  a pot for my washing, Upon Edom I cast my shoe, Over Philistia I shout habitually.
10 Who doth bring me in to the fenced city? Who hath led me unto Edom?
11 Hast not Thou, O God, cast us off? And Thou goest not out, O God, with our hosts!
12 Give to us help from adversity, And vain is the salvation of man.
13 In God we do mightily, And He doth tread down our adversaries!
