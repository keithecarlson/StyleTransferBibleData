1 A Psalm. -- A song of the dedication of the house of David. I exalt Thee, O Jehovah, For Thou hast drawn me up, and hast not let mine enemies rejoice over me.
2 Jehovah my God, I have cried to Thee, And Thou dost heal me.
3 Jehovah, Thou hast brought up from Sheol my soul, Thou hast kept me alive, From going down  the pit.
4 Sing praise to Jehovah, ye His saints, And give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness,
5 For -- a moment  in His anger, Life  in His good-will, At even remaineth weeping, and at morn singing.
6 And I -- I have said in mine ease, `I am not moved -- to the age.
7 O Jehovah, in Thy good pleasure, Thou hast caused strength to remain for my mountain,' Thou hast hidden Thy face -- I have been troubled.
8 Unto Thee, O Jehovah, I call, And unto Jehovah I make supplication.
9 `What gain  in my blood? In my going down unto corruption? Doth dust thank Thee? doth it declare Thy truth?
10 Hear, O Jehovah, and favour me, O Jehovah, be a helper to me.'
11 Thou hast turned my mourning to dancing for me, Thou hast loosed my sackcloth, And girdest me  joy.
12 So that honour doth praise Thee, and is not silent, O Jehovah, my God, to the age I thank Thee!
