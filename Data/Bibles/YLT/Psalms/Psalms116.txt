1 I have loved, because Jehovah heareth My voice, my supplication,
2 Because He hath inclined His ear to me, And during my days I call.
3 Compassed me have cords of death, And straits of Sheol have found me, Distress and sorrow I find.
4 And in the name of Jehovah I call: I pray Thee, O Jehovah, deliver my soul,
5 Gracious  Jehovah, and righteous, Yea, our God  merciful,
6 A preserver of the simple  Jehovah, I was low, and to me He giveth salvation.
7 Turn back, O my soul, to thy rest, For Jehovah hath conferred benefits on thee.
8 For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, My eyes from tears, my feet from overthrowing.
9 I walk habitually before Jehovah In the lands of the living.
10 I have believed, for I speak, I -- I have been afflicted greatly.
11 I said in my haste, `Every man  a liar.'
12 What do I return to Jehovah? All His benefits  upon me.
13 The cup of salvation I lift up, And in the name of Jehovah I call.
14 My vows to Jehovah let me complete, I pray you, before all His people.
15 Precious in the eyes of Jehovah  the death for His saints.
16 Cause  to come, O Jehovah, for I  Thy servant. I  Thy servant, son of Thy handmaid, Thou hast opened my bonds.
17 To Thee I sacrifice a sacrifice of thanks, And in the name of Jehovah I call.
18 My vows to Jehovah let me complete, I pray you, before all His people,
19 In the courts of the house of Jehovah, In thy midst, O Jerusalem, praise ye Jah!
