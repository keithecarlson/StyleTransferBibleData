1 A Psalm of David. The affirmation of Jehovah to my Lord: `Sit at My right hand, Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.'
2 The rod of thy strength doth Jehovah send from Zion, Rule in the midst of thine enemies.
3 Thy people  free-will gifts in the day of Thy strength, in the honours of holiness, From the womb, from the morning, Thou hast the dew of thy youth.
4 Jehovah hath sworn, and doth not repent, `Thou  a priest to the age, According to the order of Melchizedek.'
5 The Lord on thy right hand smote kings In the day of His anger.
6 He doth judge among the nations, He hath completed the carcases, Hath smitten the head over the mighty earth.
7 From a brook in the way he drinketh, Therefore he doth lift up the head!
