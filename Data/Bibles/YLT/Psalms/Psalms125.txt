1 A Song of the Ascents. Those trusting in Jehovah  as Mount Zion, It is not moved -- to the age it abideth.
2 Jerusalem! mountains  round about her, And Jehovah  round about His people, From henceforth even unto the age.
3 For the rod of wickedness resteth not On the lot of the righteous, That the righteous put not forth on iniquity their hands.
4 Do good, O Jehovah, to the good, And to the upright in their hearts.
5 As to those turning  their crooked ways, Jehovah causeth them to go with workers of iniquity. Peace on Israel!
