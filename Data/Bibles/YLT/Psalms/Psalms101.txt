1 A Psalm of David. Kindness and judgment I sing, To Thee, O Jehovah, I sing praise.
2 I act wisely in a perfect way, When dost Thou come in unto me? I walk habitually in the integrity of my heart, In the midst of my house.
3 I set not before mine eyes a worthless thing, The work of those turning aside I have hated, It adhereth not to me.
4 A perverse heart turneth aside from me, Wickedness I know not.
5 Whoso slandereth in secret his neighbour, Him I cut off, The high of eyes and proud of heart, him I endure not.
6 Mine eyes are on the faithful of the land, To dwell with me, Whoso is walking in a perfect way, he serveth me.
7 He dwelleth not in my house who is working deceit, Whoso is speaking lies Is not established before mine eyes.
8 At morning I cut off all the wicked of the land, To cut off from the city of Jehovah All the workers of iniquity!
