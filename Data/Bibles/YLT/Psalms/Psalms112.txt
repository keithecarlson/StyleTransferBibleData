1 Praise ye Jah! O the happiness of one fearing Jehovah, In His commands he hath delighted greatly.
2 Mighty in the earth is his seed, The generation of the upright is blessed.
3 Wealth and riches  in his house, And his righteousness is standing for ever.
4 Light hath risen in darkness to the upright, Gracious, and merciful, and righteous.
5 Good  the man -- gracious and lending, He sustaineth his matters in judgment.
6 For -- to the age he is not moved; For a memorial age-during is the righteous.
7 Of an evil report he is not afraid, Prepared is His heart, confident in Jehovah.
8 Sustained is his heart -- he feareth not, Till that he look on his adversaries.
9 He hath scattered -- hath given to the needy, His righteousness is standing for ever, His horn is exalted with honour.
10 The wicked seeth, and hath been angry, His teeth he gnasheth, and hath melted, The desire of the wicked doth perish!
