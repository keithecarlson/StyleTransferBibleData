1 A Prayer of David. Hear, O Jehovah, righteousness, attend my cry, Give ear  my prayer, without lips of deceit.
2 From before thee my judgment doth go out; Thine eyes do see uprightly.
3 Thou hast proved my heart, Thou hast inspected by night, Thou hast tried me, Thou findest nothing; My thoughts pass not over my mouth.
4 As to doings of man, Through a word of Thy lips I have observed The paths of a destroyer;
5 To uphold my goings in Thy paths, My steps have not slidden.
6 I -- I called Thee, for Thou dost answer me, O God, incline Thine ear to me, hear my speech.
7 Separate wonderfully Thy kindness, O Saviour of the confiding, By Thy right hand, from withstanders.
8 Keep me as the apple, the daughter of the eye; In shadow of Thy wings thou dost hide me.
9 From the face of the wicked who spoiled me. Mine enemies in soul go round against me.
10 Their fat they have closed up, Their mouths have spoken with pride:
11 `Our steps now have compassed ;' Their eyes they set to turn aside in the land.
12 His likeness as a lion desirous to tear, As a young lion dwelling in secret places.
13 Arise, O Jehovah, go before his face, Cause him to bend. Deliver my soul from the wicked, Thy sword,
14 From men, Thy hand, O Jehovah, From men of the world, their portion  in life, And  Thy hidden things Thou fillest their belly, They are satisfied  sons; And have left their abundance to their sucklings.
15 I -- in righteousness, I see Thy face; I am satisfied, in awaking,  Thy form!
