1 To the Overseer, for Jeduthun. -- A Psalm of David. Only -- toward God  my soul silent, From Him  my salvation.
2 Only -- He  my rock, and my salvation, My tower, I am not much moved.
3 Till when do ye devise mischief against a man? Ye are destroyed all of you, As a wall inclined, a hedge that is cast down.
4 Only -- from his excellency They have consulted to drive away, They enjoy a lie, with their mouth they bless, And with their heart revile. Selah.
5 Only -- for God, be silent, O my soul, For from Him  my hope.
6 Only -- He  my rock and my salvation, My tower, I am not moved.
7 On God  my salvation, and my honour, The rock of my strength, my refuge  in God.
8 Trust in Him at all times, O people, Pour forth before Him your heart, God  a refuge for us. Selah.
9 Only -- vanity  the low, a lie the high. In balances to go up they than vanity  lighter.
10 Trust not in oppression, And in robbery become not vain, Wealth -- when it increaseth -- set not the heart.
11 Once hath God spoken, twice I heard this, That `strength  with God.'
12 And with Thee, O Lord,  kindness, For Thou dost recompense to each, According to his work!
