1 Sing, ye righteous, in Jehovah, For upright ones praise  comely.
2 Give ye thanks to Jehovah with a harp, With psaltery of ten strings sing praise to Him,
3 Sing ye to Him a new song, Play skilfully with shouting.
4 For upright  the word of Jehovah, And all His work  in faithfulness.
5 Loving righteousness and judgment, Of the kindness of Jehovah is the earth full.
6 By the word of Jehovah The heavens have been made, And by the breath of His mouth all their host.
7 Gathering as a heap the waters of the sea, Putting in treasuries the depths.
8 Afraid of Jehovah are all the earth, Of Him are all the inhabitants of the world afraid.
9 For He hath said, and it is, He hath commanded, and it standeth.
10 Jehovah made void the counsel of nations, He disallowed the thoughts of the peoples.
11 The counsel of Jehovah to the age standeth, The thoughts of His heart to all generations.
12 O the happiness of the nation whose God  Jehovah, Of the people He did choose, For an inheritance to Him.
13 From the heavens hath Jehovah looked, He hath seen all the sons of men.
14 From the fixed place of His dwelling, He looked unto all inhabitants of the earth;
15 Who is forming their hearts together, Who is attending unto all their works.
16 The king is not saved by the multitude of a force. A mighty man is not delivered, By abundance of power.
17 A false thing  the horse for safety, And by the abundance of his strength He doth not deliver.
18 Lo, the eye of Jehovah  to those fearing Him, To those waiting for His kindness,
19 To deliver from death their soul, And to keep them alive in famine.
20 Our soul hath waited for Jehovah, Our help and our shield  He,
21 For in Him doth our heart rejoice, For in His holy name we have trusted.
22 Let Thy kindness, O Jehovah, be upon us, As we have waited for Thee!
