1 A Psalm of David. Ascribe to Jehovah, ye sons of the mighty, Ascribe to Jehovah honour and strength.
2 Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His name, Bow yourselves to Jehovah, In the beauty of holiness.
3 The voice of Jehovah  on the waters, The God of glory hath thundered, Jehovah  on many waters.
4 The voice of Jehovah  with power, The voice of Jehovah  with majesty,
5 The voice of Jehovah  shivering cedars, Yea, Jehovah shivers the cedars of Lebanon.
6 And He causeth them to skip as a calf, Lebanon and Sirion as a son of Reems,
7 The voice of Jehovah is hewing fiery flames,
8 The voice of Jehovah paineth a wilderness, Jehovah paineth the wilderness of Kadesh.
9 The voice of Jehovah paineth the oaks, And maketh bare the forests, And in His temple every one saith, `Glory.'
10 Jehovah on the deluge hath sat, And Jehovah sitteth king -- to the age,
11 Jehovah strength to his people giveth, Jehovah blesseth His people with peace!
