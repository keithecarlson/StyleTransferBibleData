1 By David. Unto Thee, O Jehovah, my soul I lift up.
2 My God, in Thee I have trusted, Let me not be ashamed, Let not mine enemies exult over me.
3 Also let none waiting on Thee be ashamed, Let the treacherous dealers without cause be ashamed.
4 Thy ways, O Jehovah, cause me to know, Thy paths teach Thou me.
5 Cause me to tread in Thy truth, and teach me, For Thou  the God of my salvation, Near Thee I have waited all the day.
6 Remember Thy mercies, O Jehovah, And Thy kindnesses, for from the age  they.
7 Sins of my youth, and my transgressions, Do not Thou remember. According to Thy kindness be mindful of me, For Thy goodness' sake, O Jehovah.
8 Good and upright  Jehovah, Therefore He directeth sinners in the way.
9 He causeth the humble to tread in judgment, And teacheth the humble His way.
10 All the paths of Jehovah  kindness and truth, To those keeping His covenant, And His testimonies.
11 For Thy name's sake, O Jehovah, Thou hast pardoned mine iniquity, for it  great.
12 Who  this -- the man fearing Jehovah? He directeth him in the way He doth choose.
13 His soul in good doth remain, And his seed doth possess the land.
14 The secret of Jehovah  for those fearing Him, And His covenant -- to cause them to know.
15 Mine eyes  continually unto Jehovah, For He bringeth out from a net my feet.
16 Turn Thou unto me, and favour me, For lonely and afflicted  I.
17 The distresses of my heart have enlarged themselves, From my distresses bring me out.
18 See mine affliction and my misery, And bear with all my sins.
19 See my enemies, for they have been many, And with violent hatred they have hated me.
20 Keep my soul, and deliver me, Let me not be ashamed, for I trusted in Thee.
21 Integrity and uprightness do keep me, For I have waited  Thee.
22 Redeem Israel, O God, from all his distresses!
