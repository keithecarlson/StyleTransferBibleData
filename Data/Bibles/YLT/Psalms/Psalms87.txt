1 By sons of Korah. -- A Psalm, a song. His foundation  in holy mountains.
2 Jehovah is loving the gates of Zion Above all the tabernacles of Jacob.
3 Honourable things are spoken in Thee, O city of God. Selah.
4 I mention Rahab and Babel to those knowing Me, Lo, Philistia, and Tyre, with Cush! This  was born there.
5 And of Zion it is said: Each one was born in her, And He, the Most High, doth establish her.
6 Jehovah doth recount in the describing of the peoples, `This  was born there.' Selah.
7 Singers also as players on instruments, All my fountains  in Thee!
