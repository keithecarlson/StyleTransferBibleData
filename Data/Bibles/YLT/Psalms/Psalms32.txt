1 By David. -- An Instruction. O the happiness of him whose transgression  forgiven, Whose sin is covered.
2 O the happiness of a man, To whom Jehovah imputeth not iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no deceit.
3 When I have kept silence, become old have my bones, Through my roaring all the day.
4 When by day and by night Thy hand is heavy upon me, My moisture hath been changed Into the droughts of summer. Selah.
5 My sin I cause Thee to know, And mine iniquity I have not covered. I have said, `I confess concerning My transgressions to Jehovah,' And Thou -- Thou hast taken away, The iniquity of my sin. Selah.
6 For this doth every saintly one pray to Thee, As the time to find. Surely at an overflowing of many waters, Unto him they come not.
7 Thou  a hiding-place for me, From distress Thou dost keep me,  songs of deliverance dost compass me. Selah.
8 I cause thee to act wisely, And direct thee in the way that thou goest, I cause mine eye to take counsel concerning thee.
9 Be ye not as a horse -- as a mule, Without understanding, With bridle and bit, its ornaments, to curb, Not to come near unto thee.
10 Many  the pains of the wicked; As to him who is trusting in Jehovah, Kindness doth compass him.
11 Be glad in Jehovah, and rejoice, ye righteous, And sing, all ye upright of heart!
