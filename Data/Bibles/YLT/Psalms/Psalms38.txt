1 A Psalm of David, `To cause to remember.' Jehovah, in Thy wrath reprove me not, Nor in Thy fury chastise me.
2 For Thine arrows have come down on me, And Thou lettest down upon me Thy hand.
3 Soundness is not in my flesh, Because of Thine indignation, Peace is not in my bones because of my sin.
4 For mine iniquities have passed over my head, As a heavy burden -- too heavy for me.
5 Stunk -- become corrupt have my wounds, Because of my folly.
6 I have been bent down, I have been bowed down -- unto excess, All the day I have gone mourning.
7 For my flanks have been full of drought, And soundness is not in my flesh.
8 I have been feeble and smitten -- unto excess, I have roared from disquietude of heart.
9 Lord, before Thee  all my desire, And my sighing from Thee hath not been hid.
10 My heart  panting, my power hath forsaken me, And the light of mine eyes, Even they are not with me.
11 My lovers and my friends over-against my plague stand. And my neighbours afar off have stood.
12 And those seeking my soul lay a snare, And those seeking my evil Have spoken mischievous things, And they do deceits meditate all the day.
13 And I, as deaf, hear not. And as a dumb one who openeth not his mouth.
14 Yea, I am as a man who heareth not, And in his mouth are no reproofs.
15 Because for Thee, O Jehovah, I have waited, Thou dost answer, O Lord my God.
16 When I said, `Lest they rejoice over me, In the slipping of my foot against me they magnified themselves.
17 For I am ready to halt, And my pain  before me continually.
18 For mine iniquity I declare, I am sorry for my sin.
19 And mine enemies  lively, They have been strong, and those hating me without cause, Have been multiplied.
20 And those paying evil for good accuse me, Because of my pursuing good.
21 Do not forsake me, O Jehovah, My God, be not far from me,
22 Haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation!
