1 Praise ye Jah! Sing ye to Jehovah a new song, His praise in an assembly of saints.
2 Israel doth rejoice in his Maker, Sons of Zion do joy in their king.
3 They praise His name in a dance, With timbrel and harp sing praise to Him.
4 For Jehovah is pleased with His people, He beautifieth the humble with salvation.
5 Exult do saints in honour, They sing aloud on their beds.
6 The exaltation of God  in their throat, And a two-edged sword in their hand.
7 To do vengeance among nations, Punishments among the peoples.
8 To bind their kings with chains, And their honoured ones with fetters of iron,
9 To do among them the judgment written, An honour it  for all his saints. Praise ye Jah!
