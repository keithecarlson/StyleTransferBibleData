1 By David. Judge me, O Jehovah, for I in mine integrity have walked, And in Jehovah I have trusted, I slide not.
2 Try me, O Jehovah, and prove me, Purified  my reins and my heart.
3 For Thy kindness  before mine eyes, And I have walked habitually in Thy truth.
4 I have not sat with vain men, And with dissemblers I enter not.
5 I have hated the assembly of evil doers, And with the wicked I sit not.
6 I wash in innocency my hands, And I compass Thine altar, O Jehovah.
7 To sound with a voice of confession, And to recount all Thy wonders.
8 Jehovah, I have loved the habitation of Thy house, And the place of the tabernacle of Thine honour.
9 Do not gather with sinners my soul, And with men of blood my life,
10 In whose hand  a wicked device, And their right hand  full of bribes.
11 And I, in mine integrity I walk, Redeem me, and favour me.
12 My foot hath stood in uprightness, In assemblies I bless Jehovah!
