1 Praise ye Jah! I thank Jehovah with the whole heart, In the secret meeting of the upright, And of the company.
2 Great  the works of Jehovah, Sought out by all desiring them.
3 Honourable and majestic is His work, And His righteousness is standing for ever.
4 A memorial He hath made of His wonders, Gracious and merciful  Jehovah.
5 Prey He hath given to those fearing Him, He remembereth to the age His covenant.
6 The power of His works He hath declared to His people, To give to them the inheritance of nations.
7 The works of His hands  true and just, Stedfast  all His appointments.
8 They are sustained for ever to the age. They are made in truth and uprightness.
9 Redemption He hath sent to His people, He hath appointed to the age His covenant, Holy and fearful  His name.
10 The beginning of wisdom  fear of Jehovah, Good understanding have all doing them, His praise  standing for ever!
