1 By David. Blessed  Jehovah my rock, who is teaching My hands for war, my fingers for battle.
2 My kind one, and my bulwark, My tower, and my deliverer, My shield, and in whom I have trusted, Who is subduing my people under me!
3 Jehovah, what  man that Thou knowest him? Son of man, that Thou esteemest him?
4 Man to vanity hath been like, His days  as a shadow passing by.
5 Jehovah, incline Thy heavens and come down, Strike against mountains, and they smoke.
6 Send forth lightning, and scatter them, Send forth Thine arrows, and trouble them,
7 Send forth Thy hand from on high, Free me, and deliver me from many waters, From the hand of sons of a stranger,
8 Because their mouth hath spoken vanity, And their right hand  a right hand of falsehood.
9 O God, a new song I sing to Thee, On a psaltery of ten strings I sing praise to Thee.
10 Who is giving deliverance to kings, Who is freeing David His servant from the sword of evil.
11 Free me, and deliver me From the hand of sons of a stranger, Because their mouth hath spoken vanity, And their right hand  a right hand of falsehood,
12 Because our sons  as plants, Becoming great in their youth, Our daughters as hewn stones, Polished -- the likeness of a palace,
13 Our garners  full, bringing out from kind to kind, Our flocks are bringing forth thousands, Ten thousands in our out-places,
14 Our oxen are carrying, there is no breach, And there is no outgoing, And there is no crying in our broad places.
15 O the happiness of the people that is thus, O the happiness of the people whose God  Jehovah!
