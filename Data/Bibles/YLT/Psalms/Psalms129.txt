1 A Song of the Ascents. Often they distressed me from my youth, Pray, let Israel say:
2 Often they distressed me from my youth, Yet they have not prevailed over me.
3 Over my back have ploughers ploughed, They have made long their furrows.
4 Jehovah  righteous, He hath cut asunder cords of the wicked.
5 Confounded and turn backward do all hating Zion.
6 They are as grass of the roofs, That before it was drawn out withereth,
7 That hath not filled the hand of a reaper, And the bosom of a binder of sheaves.
8 And the passers by have not said, `The blessing of Jehovah  on you, We blessed you in the Name of Jehovah!'
