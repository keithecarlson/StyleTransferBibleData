1 Praise ye Jah! Praise ye God in His holy place, Praise Him in the expanse of His strength.
2 Praise Him in His mighty acts, Praise Him according to the abundance of His greatness.
3 Praise Him with blowing of trumpet, Praise Him with psaltery and harp.
4 Praise Him with timbrel and dance, Praise Him with stringed instruments and organ.
5 Praise Him with cymbals of sounding, Praise Him with cymbals of shouting.
6 All that doth breathe doth praise Jah! Praise ye Jah!
