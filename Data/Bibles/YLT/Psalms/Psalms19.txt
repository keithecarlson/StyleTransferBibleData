1 To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. The heavens  recounting the honour of God, And the work of His hands The expanse  declaring.
2 Day to day uttereth speech, And night to night sheweth knowledge.
3 There is no speech, and there are no words. Their voice hath not been heard.
4 Into all the earth hath their line gone forth, And to the end of the world their sayings, For the sun He placed a tent in them,
5 And he, as a bridegroom, goeth out from his covering, He rejoiceth as a mighty one To run the path.
6 From the end of the heavens  his going out, And his revolution  unto their ends, And nothing is hid from his heat.
7 The law of Jehovah  perfect, refreshing the soul, The testimonies of Jehovah  stedfast, Making wise the simple,
8 The precepts of Jehovah  upright, Rejoicing the heart, The command of Jehovah  pure, enlightening the eyes,
9 The fear of Jehovah  clean, standing to the age, The judgments of Jehovah  true, They have been righteous -- together.
10 They are more desirable than gold, Yea, than much fine gold; and sweeter than honey, Even liquid honey of the comb.
11 Also -- Thy servant is warned by them, `In keeping them  a great reward.'
12 Errors! who doth understand? From hidden ones declare me innocent,
13 Also -- from presumptuous ones keep back Thy servant, Let them not rule over me, Then am I perfect, And declared innocent of much transgression,
14 Let the sayings of my mouth, And the meditation of my heart, Be for a pleasing thing before Thee, O Jehovah, my rock, and my redeemer!
