1 Praise ye Jah! Praise, ye servants of Jehovah. Praise the name of Jehovah.
2 The name of Jehovah is blessed, From henceforth, and unto the age.
3 From the rising of the sun unto its going in, Praised  the name of Jehovah.
4 High above all nations  Jehovah, Above the heavens  his honour.
5 Who  as Jehovah our God, He is exalting  to sit?
6 He is humbling  to look On the heavens and on the earth.
7 He is raising up from the dust the poor, From a dunghill He exalteth the needy.
8 To cause to sit with princes, With the princes of His people.
9 Causing the barren one of the house to sit, A joyful mother of sons; praise ye Jah!
