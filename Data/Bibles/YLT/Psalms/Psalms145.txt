1 Praise by David. I exalt Thee, my God, O king, And bless Thy name to the age and for ever.
2 Every day do I bless Thee, And praise Thy name to the age and for ever.
3 Great  Jehovah, and praised greatly, And of His greatness there is no searching.
4 Generation to generation praiseth Thy works, And Thy mighty acts they declare.
5 The honour -- the glory of Thy majesty, And the matters of Thy wonders I declare.
6 And the strength of Thy fearful acts they tell, And Thy greatness I recount.
7 The memorial of the abundance of Thy goodness they send forth. And Thy righteousness they sing.
8 Gracious and merciful  Jehovah, Slow to anger, and great in kindness.
9 Good  Jehovah to all, And His mercies  over all His works.
10 Confess Thee O Jehovah, do all Thy works, And Thy saints do bless Thee.
11 The honour of Thy kingdom they tell, And  Thy might they speak,
12 To make known to sons of men His mighty acts, The honour of the majesty of His kingdom.
13 Thy kingdom  a kingdom of all ages, And Thy dominion  in all generations.
14 Jehovah is supporting all who are falling, And raising up all who are bowed down.
15 The eyes of all unto Thee do look, And Thou art giving to them their food in its season,
16 Opening Thy hand, and satisfying The desire of every living thing.
17 Righteous  Jehovah in all His ways, And kind in all His works.
18 Near  Jehovah to all those calling Him, To all who call Him in truth.
19 The desire of those fearing Him He doth, And their cry He heareth, and saveth them.
20 Jehovah preserveth all those loving Him, And all the wicked He destroyeth.
21 The praise of Jehovah my mouth speaketh, And all flesh doth bless His holy name, To the age and for ever!
