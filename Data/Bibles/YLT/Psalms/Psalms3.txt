1 A Psalm of David, in his fleeing from the face of Absalom his son. Jehovah, how have my distresses multiplied! Many are rising up against me.
2 Many are saying of my soul, `There is no salvation for him in God.' Selah.
3 And Thou, O Jehovah,  a shield for me, My honour, and lifter up of my head.
4 My voice  unto Jehovah: I call: And He answereth me from his holy hill, Selah.
5 I -- I have lain down, and I sleep, I have waked, for Jehovah sustaineth me.
6 I am not afraid of myriads of people, That round about they have set against me.
7 Rise, O Jehovah! save me, my God. Because Thou hast smitten All mine enemies  the cheek. The teeth of the wicked Thou hast broken.
8 Of Jehovah  this salvation; On Thy people  Thy blessing! Selah.
