1 Praise ye Jah! Praise, O my soul, Jehovah.
2 I praise Jehovah during my life, I sing praise to my God while I exist.
3 Trust not in princes -- in a son of man, For he hath no deliverance.
4 His spirit goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, In that day have his thoughts perished.
5 O the happiness of him Who hath the God of Jacob for his help, His hope  on Jehovah his God,
6 Making the heavens and earth, The sea and all that  in them, Who is keeping truth to the age,
7 Doing judgment for the oppressed, Giving bread to the hungry.
8 Jehovah is loosing the prisoners, Jehovah is opening (the eyes of) the blind, Jehovah is raising the bowed down, Jehovah is loving the righteous,
9 Jehovah is preserving the strangers, The fatherless and widow He causeth to stand, And the way of the wicked He turneth upside down.
10 Jehovah doth reign to the age, Thy God, O Zion, to generation and generation, Praise ye Jah!
