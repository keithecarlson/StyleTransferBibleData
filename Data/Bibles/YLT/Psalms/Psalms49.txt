1 To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. A Psalm. Hear this, all ye peoples, Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world.
2 Both low and high, together rich and needy.
3 My mouth speaketh wise things, And the meditations of my heart  things of understanding.
4 I incline to a simile mine ear, I open with a harp my riddle:
5 Why do I fear in days of evil? The iniquity of my supplanters doth compass me.
6 Those trusting on their wealth, And in the multitude of their riches, Do shew themselves foolish.
7 A brother doth no one at all ransom, He doth not give to God his atonement.
8 And precious  the redemption of their soul, And it hath ceased -- to the age.
9 And still he liveth for ever, He seeth not the pit.
10 For he seeth wise men die, Together the foolish and brutish perish, And have left to others their wealth.
11 Their heart : Their houses  to the age, Their tabernacles to all generations. They proclaimed their names over the lands.
12 And man in honour doth not remain, He hath been like the beasts, they have been cut off.
13 This their way  folly for them, And their posterity with their sayings are pleased. Selah.
14 As sheep for Sheol they have set themselves, Death doth afflict them, And the upright rule over them in the morning, And their form  for consumption. Sheol  a dwelling for him.
15 Only, God doth ransom my soul from the hand of Sheol, For He doth receive me. Selah.
16 Fear not, when one maketh wealth, When the honour of his house is abundant,
17 For at his death he receiveth nothing, His honour goeth not down after him.
18 For his soul in his life he blesseth, (And they praise thee when thou dost well for thyself.)
19 It cometh to the generation of his fathers, For ever they see not the light.
20 Man in honour, who understandest not, Hath been like the beasts, they have been cut off!
