1 A Song of the Ascents. O the happiness of every one fearing Jehovah, Who is walking in His ways.
2 The labour of thy hands thou surely eatest, Happy  thou, and good  to thee.
3 Thy wife  as a fruitful vine in the sides of thy house, Thy sons as olive plants around thy table.
4 Lo, surely thus is the man blessed who is fearing Jehovah.
5 Jehovah doth bless thee out of Zion, Look, then, on the good of Jerusalem, All the days of thy life,
6 And see the sons of thy sons! Peace on Israel!
