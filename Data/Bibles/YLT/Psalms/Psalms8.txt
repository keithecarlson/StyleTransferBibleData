1 To the Overseer, `On the Gittith.' A Psalm of David. Jehovah, our Lord, How honourable Thy name in all the earth! Who settest thine honour on the heavens.
2 From the mouths of infants and sucklings Thou hast founded strength, Because of Thine adversaries, To still an enemy and a self-avenger.
3 For I see Thy heavens, a work of Thy fingers, Moon and stars that Thou didst establish.
4 What  man that Thou rememberest him? The son of man that Thou inspectest him?
5 And causest him to lack a little of Godhead, And with honour and majesty compassest him.
6 Thou dost cause him to rule Over the works of Thy hands, All Thou hast placed under his feet.
7 Sheep and oxen, all of them, And also beasts of the field,
8 Bird of the heavens, and fish of the sea, Passing through the paths of the seas!
9 Jehovah, our Lord, How honourable Thy name in all the earth!
