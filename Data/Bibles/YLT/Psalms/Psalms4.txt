1 To the Overseer with Stringed Instruments. -- A Psalm of David. In my calling answer Thou me, O God of my righteousness. In adversity Thou gavest enlargement to me; Favour me, and hear my prayer.
2 Sons of men! till when  my glory for shame? Ye love a vain thing, ye seek a lie. Selah.
3 And know ye that Jehovah Hath separated a saintly one to Himself. Jehovah heareth in my calling to Him.
4 `Tremble ye, and do not sin;' Say ye  in your heart on your bed, And be ye silent. Selah.
5 Sacrifice ye sacrifices of righteousness, And trust ye unto Jehovah.
6 Many are saying, `Who doth show us good?' Lift on us the light of Thy face, O Jehovah,
7 Thou hast given joy in my heart, From the time their corn and their wine Have been multiplied.
8 In peace together I lie down and sleep, For Thou, O Jehovah, alone, In confidence dost cause me to dwell!
