1 A Psalm of David, in his being in the wilderness of Judah. O God, Thou  my God, earnestly do I seek Thee, Thirsted for Thee hath my soul, Longed for Thee hath my flesh, In a land dry and weary, without waters.
2 So in the sanctuary I have seen Thee, To behold Thy strength and Thine honour.
3 Because better  Thy kindness than life, My lips do praise Thee.
4 So I bless Thee in my life, in Thy name I lift up my hands.
5 As  milk and fatness is my soul satisfied, And  singing lips doth my mouth praise.
6 If I have remembered Thee on my couch, In the watches -- I meditate on Thee.
7 For Thou hast been a help to me, And in the shadow of Thy wings I sing.
8 Cleaved hath my soul after Thee, On me hath Thy right hand taken hold.
9 And they who for desolation seek my soul, Go in to the lower parts of the earth.
10 They cause him to run on the edge of the sword, A portion for foxes they are.
11 And the king doth rejoice in God, Boast himself doth every one swearing by Him, But stopped is the mouth of those speaking lies!
