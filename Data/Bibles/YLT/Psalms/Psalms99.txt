1 Jehovah hath reigned, peoples tremble, The Inhabitant of the cherubs, the earth shaketh.
2 Jehovah in Zion  great, And high He  over all the peoples.
3 They praise Thy name, `Great, and fearful, holy  is.'
4 And the strength of the king Hath loved judgment, Thou -- Thou hast established uprightness; Judgment and righteousness in Jacob, Thou -- Thou hast done.
5 Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And bow yourselves at His footstool, holy  He.
6 Moses and Aaron among His priests, And Samuel among those proclaiming His name. They are calling unto Jehovah, And He doth answer them.
7 In a pillar of cloud He speaketh unto them, They have kept His testimonies, And the statute He hath given to them.
8 O Jehovah, our God, Thou hast afflicted them, A God forgiving Thou hast been to them, And taking vengeance on their actions.
9 Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And bow yourselves at His holy hill, For holy  Jehovah our God!
