1 And the son of Saul heareth that Abner  dead in Hebron, and his hands are feeble, and all Israel have been troubled.
2 And two men, heads of troops, have been  the son of Saul, the name of the one  Baanah, and the name of the second Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the sons of Benjamin, for also Beeroth is reckoned to Benjamin,
3 and the Beerothites flee to Gittaim, and are there sojourners unto this day.
4 And to Jonathan son of Saul  a son -- lame; he was a son of five years at the coming in of the rumour of [the death of] Saul and Jonathan, out of Jezreel, and his nurse lifteth him up, and fleeth, and it cometh to pass in her hasting to flee, that he falleth, and becometh lame, and his name  Mephibosheth.
5 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, go, and come in at the heat of the day unto the house of Ish-Bosheth, and he is lying down -- the lying down of noon;
6 and thither they have come, unto the midst of the house, taking wheat, and they smite him unto the fifth , and Rechab and Baanah his brother have escaped;
7 yea, they come in to the house, and he is lying on his bed, in the inner part of his bed-chamber, and they smite him, and put him to death, and turn aside his head, and they take his head, and go the way of the plain all the night,
8 and bring in the head of Ish-Bosheth unto David in Hebron, and say unto the king, `Lo, the head of Ish-Bosheth, son of Saul, thine enemy, who sought thy life; and Jehovah doth give to my lord the king vengeance this day, of Saul and of his seed.'
9 And David answereth Rechab and Baanah his brother, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and saith to them, `Jehovah liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
10 when one is declaring to me, saying, Lo, Saul is dead, and he was as a bearer of tidings in his own eyes, then I take hold on him, and slay him in Ziklag, instead of my giving to him  the tidings.
11 Also -- when wicked men have slain the righteous man in his own house, on his bed; and now, do not I require his blood of your hand, and have taken you away from the earth?'
12 And David commandeth the young men, and they slay them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hang  over the pool in Hebron, and the head of Ish-Bosheth they have taken, and bury  in the burying-place of Abner in Hebron.
