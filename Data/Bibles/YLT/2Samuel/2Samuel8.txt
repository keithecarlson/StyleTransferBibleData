1 And it cometh to pass afterwards that David smiteth the Philistines, and humbleth them, and David taketh the bridle of the metropolis out of the hand of the Philistines.
2 And he smiteth Moab, and measureth them with a line, causing them to lie down on the earth, and he measureth two lines to put to death, and the fulness of the line to keep alive, and the Moabites are to David for servants, bearers of a present.
3 And David smiteth Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah, in his going to bring back his power by the River [Euphrates;]
4 and David captureth from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen, and David destroyeth utterly the whole of the charioteers, only he leaveth of them a hundred charioteers.
5 And Aram of Damascus cometh to give help to Hadadezer king of Zobah, and David smiteth of Aram twenty and two thousand men;
6 and David putteth garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and Aram is to David for a servant, bearing a present; and Jehovah saveth David whithersoever he hath gone;
7 and David taketh the shields of gold which were on the servants of Hadadezer, and bringeth them to Jerusalem;
8 and from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, hath king David taken very much brass.
9 And Toi king of Hamath heareth that David hath smitten all the force of Hadadezer,
10 and Toi sendeth Joram his son unto king David to ask of him of welfare, and to bless him, (because that he hath fought against Hadadezer, and smiteth him, for a man of wars  Toi had Hadadezer been), and in his hand have been vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass,
11 also them did king David sanctify to Jehovah, with the silver and the gold which he sanctified of all the nations which he subdued:
12 of Aram, and of Moab, and of the Bene-Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer son of Rehob king of Zobah.
13 And David maketh a name in his turning back from his smiting Aram in the valley of Salt -- eighteen thousand;
14 and he putteth in Edom garrisons -- in all Edom he hath put garrisons, and all Edom are servants to David; and Jehovah saveth David whithersoever he hath gone.
15 And David reigneth over all Israel, and David is doing judgment and righteousness to all his people,
16 and Joab son of Zeruiah  over the host, and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud  remembrancer,
17 and Zadok son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech son of Abiathar,  priests, and Seraiah  scribe,
18 and Benaiah son of Jehoiada [is over] both the Cherethite and the Pelethite, and the sons of David have been ministers.
