1 `Hear this, O priests, and attend, O house of Israel, And, O house of the king, give ear, For the judgment  for you, For, a snare ye have been on Mizpah, And a net spread out on Tabor.
2 And to slaughter sinners have gone deep, And I  a fetter to them all.
3 I have known Ephraim, And Israel hath not been hid from me, For now thou hast gone a-whoring, Ephraim, Defiled is Israel.
4 They give not up their habitual doings, To turn back unto their God, For a spirit of whoredoms  in their midst, And Jehovah they have not known.
5 And humbled hath been the excellency of Israel to his face, And Israel and Ephraim stumble by their iniquity, Stumbled also hath Judah with them.
6 With their flock and with their herd, They go to seek Jehovah, and do not find, He hath withdrawn from them.
7 Against Jehovah they dealt treacherously, For strange sons they have begotten, Now consume them doth a month  their portions.
8 Blow ye a cornet in Gibeah, a trumpet in Ramah, Shout, O Beth-Aven, after thee, O Benjamin.
9 Ephraim is for a desolation in a day of reproof, Among the tribes of Israel I have made known a sure thing.
10 Princes of Judah have been as those removing a border, On them I do pour out as water My wrath.
11 Oppressed is Ephraim, broken in judgment, When he pleased he went after the command.
12 And I  as a moth to Ephraim, And as a rotten thing to the house of Judah.
13 And see doth Ephraim his sickness, and Judah his wound, And Ephraim goeth unto Asshur, And sendeth unto a warlike king, And he is not able to give healing to you, Nor doth he remove from you a scar.
14 For I  as a lion to Ephraim, And as a young lion to the house of Judah, I -- I tear and go, I bear away, and there is no deliverer.
15 I go -- I turn back unto My place, Till that they are desolate, and have sought My face. In their distress they do seek Me speedily!'
