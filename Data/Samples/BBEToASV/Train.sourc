<ASV> And Mattithiah and Eliphelehu and Mikneiah and Obed-edom and Jeiel and Azaziah, with corded instruments on the octave, to give the first note of the song.

<ASV> For while he gladly gave ear to our request, he was interested enough to go to you from the impulse of his heart.
<ASV> Now Joab was over all the army; and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was at the head of the Cherethites and the Pelethites;

<ASV> So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David to the taking away to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the taking away to Babylon to the coming of Christ, fourteen generations.
<ASV> With bands round their bodies and with head-dresses hanging round their heads, all of them looking like rulers, like the Babylonians, the land of whose birth is Chaldaea.
<ASV> If any part of the dead body of one of these gets on to any seed for planting, it is clean;
<ASV> My soul has kept your unchanging word; great is my love for it.
<ASV> Their thoughts are deep with evil designs; their talk from their seats of power is of cruel acts.

<ASV> And one he-goat for a sin-offering, to take away your sin:
<ASV> Then give no attention to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams: for the Lord your God is testing you, to see if all the love of your heart and soul is given to him.
<ASV> The shame of your unclothed condition will be seen by all: I will give punishment without mercy,
<ASV> I do not take honour from men;

<ASV> For I have become like a wine-skin black with smoke; but I still keep the memory of your rules.
<ASV> The bases of the wall of the town had ornaments of all sorts of beautiful stones. The first base was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;

<ASV> They get mixed grain from the field, and they take away the late fruit from the vines of those who have wealth.
<ASV> You may not have as food anything which has come to a natural death; the man from another country who is living with you may take it for food, or you may get a price for it from one of another nation; for you are a holy people to the Lord your God. The young goat is not to be cooked in its mother's milk.
<ASV> Go to Hezekiah, and say, The Lord, the God of David, your father, says, Your prayer has come to my ears, and I have seen your weeping: see, I will give you fifteen more years of life.
<ASV> Like snow in summer and rain when the grain is being cut, so honour is not natural for the foolish.
<ASV> This is what the Lord has said to me: Make for yourself bands and yokes and put them on your neck;
<ASV> And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, give ear to my voice; you wives of Lamech, give attention to my words, for I would put a man to death for a wound, and a young man for a blow;

<ASV> Then the disciples came and said to him, Did you see that the Pharisees were troubled when these words came to their ears?
<ASV> A great number will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, were we not prophets in your name, and did we not by your name send out evil spirits, and by your name do works of power?

<ASV> Everyone who comes to me and gives ear to my words and does them, I will make clear to you what he is like:
<ASV> And these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children of Israel overcame on the west side of Jordan, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, which goes up to Seir; and Joshua gave the land to the tribes of Israel for a heritage, in keeping with their divisions;

<ASV> To Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

<ASV> When he put a limit to the sea, so that the waters might not go against his word: when he put in position the bases of the earth:

<ASV> This order I give to you, Timothy my son, in harmony with the words of the prophets about you, so that by them you may be strong, fighting the good fight,

<ASV> For those who are far away from you will come to destruction: you will put an end to all those who have not kept faith with you.
<ASV> For a place of fire has long been ready; yes, it has been made ready for the king; he has made it deep and wide: it is massed with fire and much wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of fire, puts a light to it.
<ASV> See now, your servant has had grace in your eyes and great is your mercy in keeping my life from destruction, but I am not able to get as far as the mountain before evil overtakes me and death;
<ASV> But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a servant.
<ASV> But your eyes and your heart are fixed only on profit for yourself, on causing the death of him who has done no wrong, and on violent and cruel acts.
<ASV> For to those who are dear to him the Lord says sharp words, and makes the son in whom he has delight undergo pain.

<ASV> And God said to Solomon, Because this was in your heart, and you did not make request for money, property, or honour, or for the destruction of your haters, or for long life; but you have made request for wisdom and knowledge for yourself, so that you may be the judge of my people over whom I have made you king:
<ASV> For the Lord has sent out from before you nations great and strong: and they have all given way before you till this day.

<ASV> But King Joram had gone back to Jezreel to get well from the wounds which the Aramaeans had given him when he was fighting against Hazael, king of Aram.) And Jehu said, If this is your purpose, then let no one get away and go out of the town to give news of it in Jezreel.

<ASV> And on the third day Laban had news of Jacob's flight.
<ASV> Give worship to the Lord with fear, kissing his feet and giving him honour,
<ASV> The curtains of Cushan were troubled, and the tents of Midian were shaking.
<ASV> Give loud cries and make sounds of grief, O son of man: for it has come on my people, it has come on all the rulers of Israel: fear of the sword has come on my people: for this cause give signs of grief.
<ASV> Then Daniel made answer and said to the king, Keep your offerings for yourself, and give your rewards to another; but I, after reading the writing to the king, will give him the sense of it.

<ASV> In the past you put the earth on its base, and the heavens are the work of your hands.
<ASV> And you are my sheep, the sheep of my grass-lands, and I am your God, says the Lord.

<ASV> So his brothers said to him, Go away from here into Judaea so that your disciples may see the works which you do.
<ASV> And say a kind word to the church which is in their house. Give my love to my dear Epaenetus, who is the first fruit of Asia to Christ.
<ASV> And at that time I will make a division between your land and the land of Goshen where my people are, and no flies will be there; so that you may see that I am the Lord over all the earth.
<ASV> But going against the order of the Lord your God, you would not go up:
<ASV> Now Elihu had kept quiet while Job was talking, because they were older than he;
<ASV> But he is to give his first son his birthright, and twice as great a part of his property: for he is the first-fruits of his strength and the right of the first son is his.
<ASV> For this reason, O you keepers of the flock, give ear to the word of the Lord;
<ASV> And the watchman gave them word, saying, He went up to them and has not come back again; and the driving is like the driving of Jehu, son of Nimshi, for he is driving violently.
<ASV> So Moses put their cause before the Lord.
<ASV> So that day he took all the he-goats which were banded or coloured, and all the she-goats which were marked or coloured or had white marks, and all the black sheep, and gave them into the care of his sons;
<ASV> And when they came in, they went up into the room where they were living; Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James, the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas, the son of James.
<ASV> And when Moses put these words before the children of Israel, the people were full of grief.
<ASV> And that night the angel of the Lord went out and put to death in the army of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand men; and when the people got up early in the morning, there was nothing to be seen but dead bodies.

<ASV> Then Ezra got up from before the house of God and went into the room of Jehohanan, the son of Eliashib; but when he came there, he took no food or drink, for he was sorrowing for the sin of those who had come back.
<ASV> The children of Gibbar, ninety-five.
<ASV> And he got together all the chiefs of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
<ASV> This is the law of the house: On the top of the mountain all the space round it on every side will be most holy. See, this is the law of the house.
<ASV> But when the mercy of God our Saviour, and his love to man was seen,

<ASV> The man of sudden impulses will become wise in heart, and he whose tongue is slow will get the power of talking clearly.
<ASV> Our bones are broken up at the mouth of the underworld, as the earth is broken by the plough.
<ASV> And for the uprights of the House they made boards of hard wood.
<ASV> For it seems to me against reason to send a prisoner without making clear what there is against him.
<ASV> My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the desires of my heart.
<ASV> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
<ASV> The king, crying out with a loud voice, said that the users of secret arts, the Chaldaeans, and the readers of signs, were to be sent for. The king made answer and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whoever is able to make out this writing, and make clear to me the sense of it, will be clothed in purple and have a chain of gold round his neck, and will be a ruler of high authority in the kingdom.
<ASV> So, for this very cause, take every care; joining virtue to faith, and knowledge to virtue,
<ASV> Because in those days there will be great sorrow, such as there has not been from the start of the world till now, or ever will be.
<ASV> And the sons of Jacob came on them when they were wounded and made waste the town because of what had been done to their sister;
<ASV> In the visions of God he took me into the land of Israel, and put me down on a very high mountain, on which there was, as it seemed, a building like a town opposite me.
<ASV> And let us not put the Lord to the test, as some of them did, and came to their death by snakes.
<ASV> I will take the cup of salvation, and give praise to the name of the Lord.
<ASV> Reuben, the first son of Israel: the sons of Reuben by their families: of Hanoch, the family of the Hanochites: of Pallu, the family of the Palluites:
<ASV> Because of all those who are against me, I have become a word of shame to my neighbours; a cause of shaking the head and a fear to my friends: those who saw me in the street went in flight from me.
<ASV> It was the Lord's pleasure, because of his righteousness, to make the teaching great and give it honour.
<ASV> There were ninety-six apples on the outside; the number of apples all round the network was a hundred.
<ASV> And he came near and gave him a kiss; and smelling the smell of his clothing, he gave him a blessing, and said, See, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field on which the blessing of the Lord has come:
<ASV> O nation full of sin, a people weighted down with crime, a generation of evil-doers, false-hearted children: they have gone away from the Lord, they have no respect for the Holy One of Israel, their hearts are turned back from him.
<ASV> The fourth, a topaz, a beryl, and a jasper; they are to be fixed in twisted frames of gold.
<ASV> If anyone gives back evil for good, evil will never go away from his house.
<ASV> His feeling will no longer be bitter; he will not keep his wrath for ever.
<ASV> And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
<ASV> How say you, We are men of war and strong fighters?
<ASV> And the name of the star is Wormwood: and a third part of the waters became bitter; and a number of men came to their end because of the waters, for they were made bitter.
<ASV> And when everything was gone, there was no food to be had in that country, and he was in need.
<ASV> In the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the store of food in the town was almost gone, so that there was no food for the people of the land.
<ASV> From now on I will put the fear of you in all peoples under heaven, who, hearing of you, will be shaking with fear and grief of heart because of you.
<ASV> Now when Tou, king of Hamath, had news that David had overcome all the army of Hadadezer, king of Zobah,

<ASV> And there was with us a young Hebrew, the captain's servant, and when we put our dreams before him, he gave us the sense of them.
<ASV> Of the thirty, he was the noblest, and was made their captain, but he was not equal to the first three.
<ASV> The generations of the sons of Judah were numbered by their families and their fathers' houses, every male of twenty years old and over who was able to go to war;

<ASV> And I said all this to Zedekiah, king of Judah, saying, Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and become his servants and his people, so that you may keep your lives.
<ASV> And his prison clothing was changed, and he was a guest at the king's table every day for the rest of his life.
<ASV> And while he was journeying, he came near Damascus; and suddenly he saw a light from heaven shining round him;
<ASV> In my heart I take pleasure in the law of God,
<ASV> We gave you very clear orders not to give teaching in this name: and now Jerusalem is full of your teaching, and you are attempting to make us responsible for this man's death.
<ASV> The Lord has made you priest in place of Jehoiada the priest, to be an overseer in the house of the Lord for every man who is off his head and is acting as a prophet, to put such men in prison and in chains.

<ASV> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
<ASV> It is enough for the disciple that he may be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have given the name Beelzebub to the master of the house, how much more to those of his house!
<ASV> But if, in his opinion, the growth is stopped, and black hair has come up on it, the disease has gone; he is clean and the priest will say that he is clean.
<ASV> And Crispus, the ruler of the Synagogue, with all his family, had faith in the Lord; and a great number of the people of Corinth, hearing the word, had faith and were given baptism.

<ASV> Keep away from the scribes, whose pleasure it is to go about in long robes, and to have words of respect said to them in the market-places, and to take the chief seats in the Synagogues and the first places at feasts;
<ASV> Evil men have no knowledge of what is right; but those who go after the Lord have knowledge of all things.
<ASV> For those who have done good work as Deacons get for themselves a good position and become free from fear in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
<ASV> Give orders to this effect, so that no evil may be said of anyone.
<ASV> The war-carriages are rushing through the streets, pushing against one another in the wide ways, looking like burning lights, running like thunder-flames.
<ASV> And if, even after these things, you will not give ear to me, then I will send you punishment seven times more for your sins.
<ASV> Now because Israel was old, his eyes were no longer clear, and he was not able to see. So he made them come near to him, and he gave them a kiss, folding them in his arms.
<ASV> And Isaac his father said to him, Who are you? And he said, I am your oldest son, Esau.
<ASV> What is this saying of his, You will be looking for me and will not see me, and where I am you may not come?
<ASV> Then I will make you go down with those who go down into the underworld, to the people of the past, causing your living-place to be in the deepest parts of the earth, in places long unpeopled, with those who go down into the deep, so that there will be no one living in you; and you will have no glory in the land of the living.
<ASV> And I said to my master, What if the woman will not come with me?
<ASV> Where, then, are your wise men? let them make clear to you, let them give you knowledge of the purpose of the Lord of armies for Egypt.
<ASV> For even when we were with you we gave you orders, saying, If any man does no work, let him not have food.
<ASV> And he said, My masters, come now into your servant's house and take your rest there for the night, and let your feet be washed; and early in the morning you may go on your way. And they said, Not so, but we will take our night's rest in the street.
<ASV> But it is you who have been our saviour from those who were against us, and have put to shame those who had hate for us.
<ASV> Then Abraham went down on his face, and laughing, said in his heart, May a man a hundred years old have a child? will Sarah, at ninety years old, give birth?
<ASV> And they put his body into the earth with sinners, and his last resting-place was with the evil-doers, though he had done no wrong, and no deceit was in his mouth.
<ASV> I have put off my coat; how may I put it on? My feet are washed; how may I make them unclean?
<ASV> And again Bilhah, Rachel's servant, was with child, and gave birth to a second son.
<ASV> Let your search be for the Lord and for his strength; let your hearts ever be turned to him.
<ASV> And he said, Give them to me.
<ASV> Micah his son, Reaiah his son, Baal his son,
<ASV> And the high looks of man will be put to shame, and the pride of men will be made low: and only the Lord will be lifted up in that day.
<ASV> So the children of Israel will be certain that I am the Lord their God, from that day and for the future.
<ASV> Let your father and your mother be glad, let her who gave you birth have joy.
<ASV> Now you will give yourselves deep wounds for grief; they will put up a wall round us: they will give the judge of Israel a blow on the face with a rod.
<ASV> They will be crying out together like lions, their voices will be like the voices of young lions.
<ASV> The evil-doer will be taken in the net of his crimes, and prisoned in the cords of his sin.
<ASV> And it will come about that, after they have been uprooted, I will again have pity on them; and I will take them back, every man to his heritage and every man to his land.
<ASV> All is to no purpose, said the Preacher, all the ways of man are to no purpose.
<ASV> Let men give praise to the Lord for his mercy, and for the wonders which he does for the children of men!
<ASV> Whoever is simple, let him come in here; and to him who has no sense, she says:
<ASV> And this was the answer of Jesus: I have not an evil spirit; but I give honour to my Father and you do not give honour to me.
<ASV> I am the vine, you are the branches: he who is in me at all times as I am in him, gives much fruit, because without me you are able to do nothing.
<ASV> Now when Isaac was old and his eyes had become clouded so that he was not able to see, he sent for Esau, his first son, and said to him, My son: and he said, Here am I.

<ASV> Who gave us salvation from so great a death: on whom we have put our hope that he will still go on to give us salvation;

<ASV> With three lines of great stones and one line of new wood supports; and let the necessary money be given out of the king's store-house;

<ASV> And if you have not been true in your care of the property of other people, who will give you that which is yours?
<ASV> And the earth gave help to the woman, and with open mouth took up the river which the dragon sent out of his mouth.
<ASV> Like the waste from his body he comes to an end for ever: those who have seen him say, Where is he?
<ASV> And she said, God has given me a good bride-price; now at last will I have my husband living with me, for I have given him six sons: and she gave him the name Zebulun.
<ASV> Now let them put their loose ways and the dead bodies of their kings far from me, and I will be among them for ever.
<ASV> Then came a time of great need in the land, like that which had been before in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, at Gerar.
<ASV> The woman said to him, I am certain that the Messiah, who is named Christ, is coming; when he comes he will make all things clear to us.
<ASV> For before those days there was no payment for a man's work, or for the use of a beast, and there was no peace for him who went out or him who came in, because of the attacker: for I had every man turned against his neighbour.
<ASV> And you will take up your heritage in the land by the decision of the Lord, to every family its part; the greater the family the greater its heritage, and the smaller the family the smaller will be its heritage; wherever the decision of the Lord gives to any man his part, that will be his; distribution will be made to you by your fathers' tribes.
<ASV> Then they had a desire to take him: but no man put hands on him because his hour was still to come.
<ASV> And it goes down to the west to the limit of the Japhletites, to the limit of Beth-horon the lower, as far as Gezer; ending at the sea.
<ASV> By you my sorrow is turned into dancing; you have taken away my clothing of grief, and given me robes of joy;
<ASV> And the Lord gave me knowledge of it and I saw it: then you made clear to me their doings.
<ASV> And when Saul's son Ish-bosheth had news that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
<ASV> But Onan, seeing that the offspring would not be his, went in to his brother's wife, but let his seed go on to the earth, so that he might not get offspring for his brother.
<ASV> And said to me, Truly, I will make you fertile and give you increase and will make of you a great family of nations: and I will give this land to your seed after you to be their heritage for ever.
<ASV> Their children in the third generation may come into the meeting of the Lord's people.
<ASV> For their thoughts were bitter against you: they had an evil design in their minds, which they were not able to put into effect.
<ASV> And do what is upright and good in the eyes of the Lord your God, so that it may be well for you and you may go in and take for your heritage that good land from which the Lord undertook by an oath to your fathers,
<ASV> For they had seen him before in the town with Trophimus of Ephesus, and had the idea that Paul had taken him with him into the Temple.
<ASV> But praise be to God, who puts the same care for you into the heart of Titus.
<ASV> And he had the house of the Lord and the king's house and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burned with fire:
<ASV> But we have a desire to give hearing to your opinion: for as to this form of religion, we have knowledge that in all places it is attacked.
<ASV> Which have come to our hearing and our knowledge, as they were given to us by our fathers.
<ASV> And so, though I might, in the name of Christ, give you orders to do what is right,
<ASV> But your father has not kept faith with me, and ten times he has made changes in my payment; but God has kept him from doing me damage.
<ASV> If we are questioned today about a good work done to a man who was ill, as to how he has been made well,
<ASV> And he took the dragon, the old snake, which is the Evil One and Satan, and put chains on him for a thousand years,
<ASV> A king, by right rule, makes the land safe; but one full of desires makes it a waste.
<ASV> A man to whom God gives money, wealth, and honour so that he has all his desires but God does not give him the power to have joy of it, and a strange man takes it. This is to no purpose and an evil disease.
<ASV> Inside the ark you are to put the record which I will give you.
<ASV> And when he came to the place, he said to them, Make a prayer that you may not be put to the test.
<ASV> This is the man who was in the church in the waste land with the angel who was talking to him in Sinai, and with our fathers; and to him were given the living words of God, so that he might give them to you.
<ASV> But the tongue may not be controlled by man; it is an unresting evil, it is full of the poison of death.
<ASV> When you said, Make search for my face, my heart said to you, For your face will I make my search.
<ASV> So that in the ears of the people the cry of joy was mixed with the sound of weeping; for the cries of the people were loud and came to the ears of those who were a long way off.
<ASV> Your feasts are disgusting to me, I will have nothing to do with them; I will take no delight in your holy meetings.
<ASV> Then Joseph, unable to keep back his feelings before those who were with him, gave orders for everyone to be sent away, and no one was present when he made clear to his brothers who he was.
<ASV> And they went after them as far as Jordan; and all the road was covered with clothing and vessels dropped by the Aramaeans in their flight. So those who were sent went back and gave the news to the king.
<ASV> And David was full of wrath against that man; and he said to Nathan, By the living Lord, death is the right punishment for the man who has done this:
<ASV> The sons of Simeon by their families: of Nemuel, the family of the Nemuelites: of Jamin, the family of the Jaminites: of Jachin, the family of the Jachinites:
<ASV> At that time, says the Lord, they will take the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his rulers, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the people of Jerusalem out of their resting-places:
<ASV> And when they were going out from Jericho, a great number went after him.
<ASV> Say no hard things against one another, brothers, so that you will not be judged; see, the judge is waiting at the doors.
<ASV> Anything which comes from God is able to overcome the world: and the power by which we have overcome the world is our faith.
<ASV> Making their land a thing of wonder, causing sounds of surprise for ever; everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder, shaking his head.
<ASV> And David sent to Joab saying, Send Uriah the Hittite to me. And Joab sent Uriah to David.
<ASV> And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon; all the towns are twenty-nine, with their unwalled places.
<ASV> The Preacher made search for words which were pleasing, but his writing was in words upright and true.
<ASV> Or is God the God of Jews only? is he not in the same way the God of Gentiles? Yes, of Gentiles:
<ASV> Only, as the Lord has given to a man, and as is the purpose of God for him, so let him go on living. And these are my orders for all the churches.
<ASV> He has made the earth by his power, he has made the world strong in its place by his wisdom, and by his wise design the heavens have been stretched out:
<ASV> And Hoshea, the son of Elah, made a secret design against Pekah, the son of Remaliah, and, attacking him, put him to death and became king in his place, in the twentieth year of Jotham, the son of Uzziah.
<ASV> Now when it was day, the armed men were greatly troubled about what had become of Peter.
<ASV> Ladan was his son, Ammihud his son, Elishama his son,
<ASV> And all the years of Methuselah's life were nine hundred and sixty-nine: and he came to his end.
<ASV> And that you may keep in mind all my orders and do them and be holy to your God.
<ASV> And a certain captain had a servant who was very dear to him; this servant was ill and near to death.
<ASV> And Moses said, We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds; for we are to keep a feast to the Lord.
<ASV> For they are an uncontrolled people, false-hearted, who will not give ear to the teaching of the Lord:
<ASV> And still, I am as strong today as I was when Moses sent me out: as my strength was then, so is it now, for war and for all the business of life.
<ASV> And the lord of that servant, being moved with pity, let him go, and made him free of the debt.
<ASV> Be not given overmuch to righteousness and be not over-wise. Why let destruction come on you?
<ASV> The one went away from me, and I said, Truly he has come to a violent death; and from that time I have not seen him,
<ASV> And the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go, or the number will be over-great for you. And he made his request again, but he would not go, but he gave him his blessing.
<ASV> And when his words came to the ears of Jehoiakim the king and all his men of war and his captains, the king would have put him to death; but Uriah, hearing of it, was full of fear and went in flight into Egypt:
<ASV> And the son of Hezekiah was Manasseh; and the son of Manasseh was Amon; and the son of Amon was Josiah;
<ASV> By them is your servant made conscious of danger, and in keeping them there is great reward.
<ASV> In so far as you have the light, put your faith in the light so that you may become sons of light. With these words Jesus went away and for a time was not seen again by them.
<ASV> Eyes of pride, a false tongue, hands which take life without cause;
<ASV> But if he undergoes punishment as a Christian, that is no shame to him; let him give glory to God in this name.
<ASV> Then the rulers said to the king, Let this man be put to death, because he is putting fear into the hearts of the men of war who are still in the town, and into the hearts of the people, by saying such things to them: this man is not working for the well-being of the people, but for their damage.
<ASV> Let the Lord be praised. Give praise to God in his holy place: give him praise in the heaven of his power.
<ASV> The evil-doers are not so; but are like the dust from the grain, which the wind takes away.
<ASV> This is what the Lord has said: These are the limits by which you will take up your heritage in the land among the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph is to have two parts.
<ASV> See, I am doing a new thing; now it is starting; will you not take note of it? I will even make a way in the waste land, and rivers in the dry country.
<ASV> And this was the answer of Jesus: I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never be in need of food, and he who has faith in me will never be in need of drink.
<ASV> And it is he who has put his stamp on us, even the Spirit, as the sign in our hearts of the coming glory.
<ASV> Make them holy by the true word: your word is the true word.
<ASV> Then Paul and those who were with him went by ship from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia: and there John went away from them and came back to Jerusalem.
<ASV> And it came about that as they would not give ear to his voice, so I would not give ear to their voice, says the Lord of armies:
<ASV> The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's servant: Dan and Naphtali;
<ASV> And he made low your pride and let you be without food and gave you manna for your food, a thing new to you, which your fathers never saw; so that he might make it clear to you that bread is not man's only need, but his life is in every word which comes out of the mouth of the Lord.
<ASV> And when the voice of Mary came to the ears of Elisabeth, the baby made a sudden move inside her; then Elisabeth was full of the Holy Spirit,
<ASV> And any man of Israel, or any other living among them, who gets with his bow any beast or bird used for food, is to see that its blood is covered with earth.
<ASV> Now John was then giving baptism at Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and people came and were given baptism.
<ASV> Who is able to say, I have made my heart clean, I am free from my sin?
<ASV> Are you still uplifted in pride against my people so that you will not let them go?
<ASV> The Lord is living; praise be to my Rock, and let the God of my salvation be honoured:
<ASV> For the son puts shame on his father, the daughter goes against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and a man's haters are those of his family.
<ASV> Who say, This is not the time for building houses: this town is the cooking-pot and we are the flesh.
<ASV> It is an old disease in the skin of his flesh, and the priest will say that he is unclean; he will not have to be shut up, for he is clearly unclean.
<ASV> And the king will do his pleasure; he will put himself on high, lifting himself over every god, and saying things to be wondered at against the God of gods; and all will be well for him till the wrath is complete; for what has been purposed will be done.
<ASV> Then he took the captains of hundreds and the chiefs and the rulers of the people and all the people of the land, and they came down with the king from the house of the Lord through the higher doorway into the king's house, and put the king on the seat of the kingdom.
<ASV> Took branches of palm-trees and went out to him, crying, A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!
<ASV> And made a request for letters from him to the Synagogues of Damascus, so that if there were any of the Way there, men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem.
<ASV> But you, my brothers, are not in the dark, for that day to overtake you like a thief:
<ASV> And of the sons of Zattu, Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth and Zabad and Aziza.
<ASV> And the army of your attackers will be like small dust, and all the cruel ones like dry stems gone before the wind; suddenly it will come about.
<ASV> See, in every common saying about you it will be said, As the mother is, so is her daughter.
<ASV> And Tamar, his daughter-in-law, had Perez and Zerah by him. All the sons of Judah were five.
<ASV> The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a snake on a rock; the way of a ship in the heart of the sea; and the way of a man with a girl.
<ASV> Then we went on from Horeb, through all that great and cruel waste which you saw, on our way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as the Lord gave us orders; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.
<ASV> And there came a scribe and said to him, Master, I will come after you wherever you go.
<ASV> Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came to get water for their father's flock.
<ASV> And now to us the men of pride seem happy; yes, the evil-doers are doing well; they put God to the test and are safe.
<ASV> I will put to death anyone who says evil of his neighbour secretly; the man with a high look and a heart of pride is disgusting to me.
<ASV> This was the first numbering, which was made when Quirinius was ruler of Syria.
<ASV> Because the Lord sees the way of the upright, but the end of the sinner is destruction.
<ASV> That you take note of my sin, searching after my wrongdoing,
<ASV> Be glad and full of joy; for great is your reward in heaven: for so were the prophets attacked who were before you.
<ASV> You have gone in the way of your sister; and I will give her cup into your hand.
<ASV> But if anyone says to you, This food has been used as an offering, do not take it, on account of him who said it, and on account of his sense of right and wrong:
<ASV> So then you are no longer as those who have no part or place in the kingdom of God, but you are numbered among the saints, and of the family of God,
<ASV> See, I will put a spirit into him, and bad news will come to his ears, and he will go back to his land; and there I will have him put to death.
<ASV> I, even I, am the Lord; and there is no saviour but me.
<ASV> And if you are able to see it, this is Elijah who was to come.
<ASV> And they came near the town to which they were going, and he seemed as if he was going on;
<ASV> He whose desires are fixed on profit is a cause of trouble to his family; but he who has no desire for offerings will have life.
<ASV> You are clean, even now, through the teaching which I have given you.
<ASV> Their line has gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them has he put a tent for the sun,
<ASV> For the Levites have no part among you; to be the Lord's priests is their heritage; and Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have had their heritage on the east side of Jordan, given to them by Moses, the servant of the Lord.
<ASV> He will send blessings on the worshippers of the Lord, on the small and on the great.
<ASV> The heritage of the good man is handed down to his children's children; and the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the upright man.
<ASV> Will it be good for you to be searched out by him, or have you the thought that he may be guided into error like a man?
<ASV> Let the priests, the servants of the Lord, be weeping between the covered way and the altar, and let them say, Have mercy on your people, O Lord, do not give up your heritage to shame, so that the nations become their rulers: why let them say among the peoples, Where is their God?
<ASV> And he gave the divisions of the priests their places for their work, as ordered by his father David, and to the Levites he gave their work of praise and waiting on the priests, to do what was needed day by day; and he gave the door-keepers their places in turn at every door; for so David, the man of God, had given orders.
<ASV> Then the king gave Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego even greater authority in the land of Babylon.
<ASV> But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with them, for fear, as he said, that some evil might come to him.
<ASV> But their bows were broken by a strong one, and the cords of their arms were cut by the Strength of Jacob, by the name of the Stone of Israel:
<ASV> I saw with hate those who were untrue to you; for they did not keep your saying.
<ASV> I will make my arrows red with blood, my sword will be feasting on flesh, with the blood of the dead and the prisoners, of the long-haired heads of my haters.
<ASV> For in the book of Psalms it says, Let his house be waste, and let no man be living in it: and, Let his position be taken by another.
<ASV> But I have no need of a man's witness: I only say these things so that you may have salvation.
<ASV> This is what the king says: Do not be tricked by Hezekiah, for there is no salvation for you in him.
<ASV> For our glory is in this, in the knowledge which we have that our way of life in the world, and most of all in relation to you, has been holy and true in the eyes of God; not in the wisdom of the flesh, but in the grace of God.
<ASV> Which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, did not take away, when he took Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, a prisoner from Jerusalem to Babylon, with all the great men of Judah and Jerusalem;
<ASV> And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the Lord is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
<ASV> You who say that a man may not be untrue to his wife, are you true to yours? you who are a hater of images, do you do wrong to the house of God?
<ASV> And on to the north side of Beth-hoglah, ending at the north inlet of the Salt Sea at the south end of Jordan; this is their limit on the south.
<ASV> And the priest is to take some of the blood of the offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burned offering, draining out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar of burned offering.
<ASV> But he said to them, Not all men are able to take in this saying, but only those to whom it is given.
<ASV> So Solomon came to the end of building the house of the Lord and the king's house; and everything which it was in his mind to make in the house of the Lord and for himself had been well done.
<ASV> You put unclean bread on my altar. And you say, How have we made it unclean? By your saying, The table of the Lord is of no value.
<ASV> Then let the owner of the house come and say to the priest, It seems to me that there is a sort of leper's disease in the house.
<ASV> He takes the produce of the mountains, where all the beasts of the field are at play.
<ASV> They have overcome me, you will say, and I have no pain; they gave me blows without my feeling them: when will I be awake from my wine? I will go after it again.
<ASV> And straight away he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, till he had sent the people away.

<ASV> For in him we have life and motion and existence; as certain of your verse writers have said, For we are his offspring.
<ASV> And the feast of the grain-cutting, the first-fruits of your planted fields: and the feast at the start of the year, when you have got in all the fruit from your fields.
<ASV> And keep in that same house, taking what food and drink they give you: for the worker has a right to his reward. Do not go from house to house.

<ASV> It is better to have faith in the Lord than to put one's hope in rulers.
<ASV> This is the offering you are to give: a sixth of an ephah out of a homer of wheat, and a sixth of an ephah out of a homer of barley;
<ASV> Those whom the Lord has made free will come back with songs to Zion; and on their heads will be eternal joy: delight and joy will be theirs, and sorrow and sounds of grief will be gone for ever.
<ASV> He took David to be his servant, taking him from the place of the flocks;
<ASV> Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
<ASV> Because you have been pushing with side and leg, pushing the diseased with your horns till they were sent away in every direction;
<ASV> But if the one who is not a Christian has a desire to go away, let it be so: the brother or the sister in such a position is not forced to do one thing or the other: but it is God's pleasure that we may be at peace with one another.
<ASV> This man went to Pilate and made a request for the body of Jesus.
<ASV> But a small number of them I will keep from the sword, from the need of food, and from disease, so that they may make clear all their disgusting ways among the nations where they come; and they will be certain that I am the Lord.
<ASV> Take no bag for money or for food, and no shoes; say no word to any man on the way.
<ASV> But still some of you have no faith. For it was clear to Jesus from the first who they were who had no faith, and who it was who would be false to him.
<ASV> Then the Lord will send these nations in flight before you, and you will take the lands of nations greater and stronger than yourselves.
<ASV> Their food is to be the meal offering and the sin-offering and the offering for error; and everything given specially to the Lord in Israel will be theirs.

<ASV> For he gives to every man the reward of his work, and sees that he gets the fruit of his ways.
<ASV> But now, having no longer any place in these parts and having had for a number of years a great desire to come to you,
<ASV> For I will be to Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the children of Judah; I, even I, will give him wounds and go away; I will take him away, and there will be no helper.
<ASV> And let this be an order for ever for you, so that the sin of the children of Israel may be taken away once every year. And he did as the Lord gave orders to Moses.

<ASV> For the divisions of the door-keepers: of the Korahites, Meshelemiah, the son of Kore, of the sons of Ebiasaph.
<ASV> The glory, O Israel, is dead on your high places! How have the great ones been made low!
<ASV> And no price may be offered for one who has gone in flight to a safe town, for the purpose of letting him come back to his place before the death of the high priest.
<ASV> Or with rulers who had gold, and whose houses were full of silver;

<ASV> My loved ones, do not put your faith in every spirit, but put them to the test, to see if they are from God: because a great number of false prophets have gone out into the world.

<ASV> He who gives you the Spirit, and does works of power among you, is it by the works of law, or by the hearing of faith?

<ASV> There is no man on earth of such righteousness that he does good and is free from sin all his days.
<ASV> But now that you have come to have knowledge of God, or more truly, God has knowledge of you, how is it that you go back again to the poor and feeble first things, desiring to be servants to them again?
<ASV> To those who go on with good works in the hope of glory and honour and salvation from death, he will give eternal life:

<ASV> And the vessels which have been given to you for the uses of the house of your God, you are to give to the God of Jerusalem.
<ASV> As those who are free, not using your free position as a cover for wrongdoing, but living as the servants of God;
<ASV> You do not give water to the tired traveller, and from him who has no food you keep back bread.

<ASV> At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of his great house in Babylon.

<ASV> And no one was able to give him an answer, and so great was their fear of him, that from that day no one put any more questions to him.
<ASV> And Jeuz and Shachia and Mirmah. These were his sons, heads of families.
<ASV> For the cry has gone round the limits of Moab; as far as to Eglaim and Beer-elim.
<ASV> When the face of the earth has been levelled, does he not put in the different sorts of seed, and the grain in lines, and the barley in its place, and the spelt at the edge?
<ASV> And how I kept back nothing which might be of profit to you, teaching you publicly and privately,

<ASV> And I said to the angel who was talking to me, Where are they taking the ephah?

<ASV> Take up now a song of grief for the ruler of Israel, and say,
<ASV> And so comforting them with these and other words, he gave the good news to the people;

<ASV> Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,
<ASV> If men, while fighting, do damage to a woman with child, causing the loss of the child, but no other evil comes to her, the man will have to make payment up to the amount fixed by her husband, in agreement with the decision of the judges.
<ASV> The hand of her hater is stretched out over all her desired things; for she has seen that the nations have come into her holy place, about whom you gave orders that they were not to come into the meeting of your people.
<ASV> To the only God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, let us give glory and honour and authority and power, before all time and now and for ever. So be it.
<ASV> And the ruler of the land said, In this way I may be certain that you are true men; let one of you be kept here with me, while you go and take grain for the needs of your families;
<ASV> That it may be burned by Aaron's sons on the altar, on the burned offering which is on the wood on the fire: it is an offering made by fire of a sweet smell to the Lord.
<ASV> And that your hand is on him every morning, and that you are testing him every minute?
<ASV> And I made controllers over the store-houses, Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and with them was Hanan, the son of Zaccur the son of Mattaniah: they were taken to be true men and their business was the distribution of these things to their brothers.
<ASV> And the sons of Midian: Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah. All these were the sons of Keturah.
<ASV> The tax-farmer, on the other hand, keeping far away, and not lifting up even his eyes to heaven, made signs of grief and said, God, have mercy on me, a sinner.

<ASV> And when the fourth stamp was undone, the voice of the fourth beast came to my ears, saying, Come and see.
<ASV> Do not evil and good come from the mouth of the Most High?
<ASV> Let not those who have hope in you be put to shame because of me, O Lord God of armies: let not those who are waiting for you be made low because of me, O God of Israel.
<ASV> So you will take away the crime of a death without cause from among you, when you do what is right in the eyes of the Lord.
<ASV> May the seat of his authority be before God for ever; may mercy and righteousness keep him safe.

<ASV> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah?

<ASV> For see, I will put a sheep-keeper over the land, who will have no care for that which is cut off, and will not go in search of the wanderers, or make well what is broken, and he will not give food to that which is ill, but he will take for his food the flesh of the fat, and let their feet be broken.

<ASV> And Moses saw that the people were out of control, for Aaron had let them loose to their shame before their haters:
<ASV> Then Esther said, If it is the king's pleasure, let authority be given to the Jews in Shushan to do tomorrow as has been done today, and let orders be given for the hanging of Haman's ten sons.
<ASV> And Zerubbabel had Abiud; and Abiud had Eliakim; and Eliakim had Azor;
<ASV> And he went quickly in front of them and got up into a tree to see him, for he was going that way.
<ASV> And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, This is the law of the Passover: no man who is not an Israelite is to take of it:
<ASV> He takes away his fear of danger and gives him support; and his eyes are on his ways.
<ASV> But, at the same time, of those beasts, you may not take for food the camel, because its food comes back but the horn of its foot is not parted in two; it is unclean to you.
<ASV> Then Jacob gave him bread and soup; and he took food and drink and went away, caring little for his birthright.
<ASV> To you, Judah, will your brothers give praise: your hand will be on the neck of your haters; your father's sons will go down to the earth before you.
<ASV> He made walled towns in Judah, for the land was quiet and there were no wars in those years, because the Lord had given him rest.
<ASV> And those who are wise among the people will be the teachers of the mass of the people: but they will come to their downfall by the sword and by the flame, being made prisoners and undergoing loss for a long time.
<ASV> So then am I no longer your friend, because I give you true words?
<ASV> And the flesh and the skin were burned with fire outside the tent-circle;
<ASV> The sun comes up, and they come together, and go back to their secret places to take their rest.
<ASV> And no one who is living and has faith in me will ever see death. Is this your faith?

<ASV> And when he had gone out into the doorway, another saw him and says to those who were there, This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.
<ASV> And last of all, the prayer which we make to you from our heart and in the name of the Lord Jesus, is this: that as we made clear to you what sort of behaviour is pleasing to God, as in fact you are doing now, so you will go on in these ways, but more and more.
<ASV> As Babylon had the dead of Israel put to the sword, so in Babylon the dead of all the land will be stretched out.
<ASV> Our store-houses are full of all good things; and our sheep give birth to thousands and ten thousands in our fields.
<ASV> Now in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, in the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, a servant of the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem.
<ASV> Anathoth and Almon with their grass-lands, four towns.
<ASV> The words of Lemuel, king of Massa: the teaching which he had from his mother.
<ASV> And I myself will be fighting against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even with angry feeling and passion and in great wrath.
<ASV> It is right, our Lord and our God, for you to have glory and honour and power: because by you were all things made, and by your desire they came into being.
<ASV> And Cush was the father of Nimrod, who was the first of the great men of the earth.
<ASV> And Adoraim and Lachish and Azekah
<ASV> Now when they had gone through Amphipolis and Apollonia they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Synagogue of the Jews:
<ASV> The coat is to be made of the best linen, worked in squares; and you are to make a head-dress of linen, and a linen band worked in needlework.
<ASV> He makes a fertile country into a salt waste, because of the sins of those who are living there.
<ASV> And as you have made your souls clean, being ruled by what is true, and loving one another without deceit, see that your love is warm and from the heart:
<ASV> I go about in dark clothing, uncomforted; I get up in the public place, crying out for help.
<ASV> And he put the image he had made in the house of God, the house of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, the town which I have made mine out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
<ASV> And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, at Kiriath-arba, that is, Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac had been living.
<ASV> And the flesh of the praise-offering is to be taken as food on the day when it is offered; no part of it may be kept till the morning.
<ASV> You say evil of your brother; you make false statements against your mother's son.
<ASV> Then his place will be taken by one who will send out a man with the glory of a king to get wealth together; but after a short time destruction will overtake him, but not in wrath or in the fight.
<ASV> So they put overseers of forced work over them, in order to make their strength less by the weight of their work. And they made store-towns for Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses.
<ASV> Now I say this for your profit; not to make things hard for you, but because of what is right, and so that you may be able to give all your attention to the things of the Lord.
<ASV> And all these kings and their land Joshua took at the same time, because the Lord, the God of Israel, was fighting for Israel.
<ASV> You will not be touched by the sun in the day, or by the moon at night.
<ASV> And as for me, when I came from Paddan, death overtook Rachel on the way, when we were still some distance from Ephrath; and I put her to rest there on the road to Ephrath, which is Beth-lehem.
<ASV> Come out from among this people, so that I may send sudden destruction on them. And they went down on their faces.
<ASV> So that place was named Kibroth-hattaavah; because there they put in the earth the bodies of the people who had given way to their desires.
<ASV> And that same hour of the night, he took them, and when he had given attention to their wounds, he and all his family had baptism straight away.
<ASV> Such as all the different sorts of locust.
<ASV> Why? because I have no love for you? let God be judge.
<ASV> For he was full of wonder and so were all those who were with him, at the number of fish which they had taken;
<ASV> Death overtook our father in the waste land; he was not among those who were banded together with Korah against the Lord; but death came to him in his sin; and he had no sons.
<ASV> So the town was shut in by their forces till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
<ASV> And now, turning away from evil, you had done what is right in my eyes, giving a public undertaking for every man to make his neighbour free; and you had made an agreement before me in the house which is named by my name:
<ASV> And when she and her family had had baptism, she made a request to us, saying, If it seems to you that I am true to the Lord, come into my house and be my guests. And she made us come.
<ASV> What came into existence in him was life, and the life was the light of men.
<ASV> Our soul has gone free like a bird out of the net of those who would take her: the net is broken, and we are free.
<ASV> And you are to make no houses, or put in seed, or get vine-gardens planted, or have any: but all your days you are to go on living in tents, so that you may have a long life in the land where you are living as in a strange country.
<ASV> Keep it till the fourteenth day of the same month, when everyone who is of the children of Israel is to put it to death between sundown and dark.
<ASV> Your chiefs have made my holy place unclean, so I have made Jacob a curse, and Israel a thing of shame.
<ASV> And the man gave names to all cattle and to the birds of the air and to every beast of the field; but Adam had no one like himself as a help.
<ASV> So that as Jesus was put to death in the flesh, do you yourselves be of the same mind; for the death of the flesh puts an end to sin;
<ASV> So that my glory may make songs of praise to you and not be quiet. O Lord my God, I will give you praise for ever.
<ASV> O give praise to the Lord; give honour to his name, talking of his doings among the peoples.
<ASV> But you will come to death like men, falling like one of the rulers of the earth.
<ASV> Come quickly to give me help, O Lord, my salvation.
<ASV> What does a man get for all his work, and for the weight of care with which he has done his work under the sun?
<ASV> By taking as her lover another man, and keeps it secret so that her husband has no knowledge of it, and there is no witness against her, and she is not taken in the act;
<ASV> These are the words of the Lord: See, I will send evil on this place and on its people, even all the curses in the book which they have been reading before the king of Judah;
<ASV> You are to keep the feast of tents for seven days after you have got in all your grain and made your wine:
<ASV> For when we were in the flesh, the evil passions which came into being through the law were working in our bodies to give the fruit of death.
<ASV> There were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab and Abishai and Asahel: and Asahel was as quick-footed as a roe of the fields.
<ASV> For if I give you sorrow, who then will make me glad, but he who is made sad by me?
<ASV> The sea was getting rough because of a strong wind which was blowing.
<ASV> And not long after, the younger son got together everything which was his and took a journey into a far-away country, and there all his money went in foolish living.
<ASV> You gave a cry in your trouble, and I made you free; I gave you an answer in the secret place of the thunder; I put you to the test at the waters of Meribah. (Selah.)
<ASV> See, O Lord, for I am in trouble; the inmost parts of my body are deeply moved; my heart is turned in me; for I have been uncontrolled: outside the children are put to the sword, and in the house there is death.
<ASV> Come back, you children who have been turned away, and I will take away your desire for wandering. See, we have come to you, for you are the Lord our God.
<ASV> And when he had said this, he let them see his hands and his feet.
<ASV> And one he-goat for a sin-offering; in addition to the regular burned offering, its meal offering, and its drink offering.
<ASV> The king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of God is housed inside the curtains of a tent.
<ASV> Then the king said to Ziba, Truly everything which was Mephibosheth's is yours. And Ziba said, I give honour to my lord, may I have grace in your eyes, my lord, O king!
<ASV> Let the heavens have joy and the earth be glad; let the sea be thundering with all its waters;
<ASV> But the houses in the towns of the Levites may be got back by the Levites at any time.
<ASV> Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of the Hittites under Hermon; and they came to Dan, and from Dan they came round to Zidon,
<ASV> Let them be overcome and put to shame who make attempts to take my soul; let those who would do me damage be turned back and made foolish.
<ASV> So then those who are of faith have a part in the blessing of Abraham who was full of faith.
<ASV> Now David, having done God's work for his generation, went to sleep, and was put with his fathers, and his body came to destruction:
<ASV> And a strong order will be sent out against the great number for one week; and so for half of the week the offering and the meal offering will come to an end; and in its place will be an unclean thing causing fear; till the destruction which has been fixed is let loose on him who has made waste.
<ASV> He sends the strong to destruction without searching out their cause, and puts others in their place.
<ASV> And if I go and make ready a place for you, I will come back again and will take you to be with me, so that you may be where I am.
<ASV> Now these are the kings who were ruling in the land of Edom, before there was any king over Israel: Bela, the son of Beor; his town was named Dinhabah.
<ASV> So on the tenth day of the first month the people came up out of Jordan, and put up their tents in Gilgal, on the east side of Jericho.
<ASV> And he said to him, Have love for the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.

<ASV> Then Amnon said to Tamar, Take the food and come into my bedroom, so that I may take it from your hand. So Tamar took the cakes she had made and went with them into her brother Amnon's bedroom.
<ASV> And Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, Go and make the Passover ready for us, so that we may take it.
<ASV> And I will let you be in the waste land, you and all the fish of your streams: you will go down on the face of the land; you will not be taken up or put to rest in the earth; I have given you for food to the beasts of the field and the birds of the heaven.
<ASV> And a shade in the daytime from the heat, and a safe cover from storm and from rain.
<ASV> Then Pharaoh quickly sent for Moses and Aaron, and said, I have done evil against the Lord your God and against you.
<ASV> He was reading it in the wide place in front of the water-doorway, from early morning till the middle of the day, in the hearing of all those men and women whose minds were able to take it in; and the ears of all the people were open to the book of the law.
<ASV> He had never enough for his desire; for this cause his well-being will quickly come to an end.
<ASV> I have put your evil doings out of my mind like a thick cloud, and your sins like a mist: come back to me; for I have taken up your cause.
<ASV> But about Israel he says; All the day my hands have been stretched out to a people whose hearts were turned away, and who put themselves against my word.
<ASV> The underworld is moved at your coming: the shades of the dead are awake before you, even the strong ones of the earth; all the kings of the world have got up from their seats.
<ASV> So that you are witnesses against yourselves that you are the sons of those who put the prophets to death.
<ASV> You have come here today, all of you, before the Lord your God; the heads of your tribes, the overseers, and those who are in authority over you, with all the men of Israel,
<ASV> And after him, his brother came out, gripping Esau's foot; and he was named Jacob: Isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them.
<ASV> And they will send up a song of grief for you, and say to you, What destruction has come on you, how are you cut off from the sea, the noted town, which was strong in the sea, she and her people, causing the fear of them to come on all the dry land!
<ASV> If only you give ear to the voice of the Lord your God, and take care to keep all these orders which I give you today.
<ASV> I gave you your master's daughter and your master's wives for yourself, and I gave you the daughters of Israel and Judah; and if that had not been enough, I would have given you such and such things.

<ASV> When you have come into the land which the Lord your God is giving you, and have taken it for a heritage and are living in it, if it is your desire to have a king over you, like the other nations round about you;
<ASV> A vision of fear comes before my eyes; the worker of deceit goes on in his false way, and the waster goes on making waste. Up! Elam; to the attack! Media; I have put an end to her sorrow.

<ASV> For Zedekiah, king of Judah, had had him shut up, saying, Why have you, as a prophet, been saying, The Lord has said, See, I will give this town into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will take it;
<ASV> For fear of the great body of people, or for fear that families might make sport of me, so that I kept quiet, and did not go out of my door;
<ASV> And what sort of land they are living in, if it is good or bad; and what their living-places are, tent-circles or walled towns;

<ASV> And I saw high seats, and they were seated on them, and the right of judging was given to them: and I saw the souls of those who were put to death for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and those who did not give worship to the beast, or to his image, and had not his mark on their brows or on their hands; and they were living and ruling with Christ a thousand years.
<ASV> You will have the fruit of the work of your hands: happy will you be, and all will be well for you.

<ASV> But the evil-doers, all of them, will be like thorns to be pushed away, because they may not be gripped in the hand:
<ASV> These are the names of the chiefs of Esau in the order of their families and their places: Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,
<ASV> And Isaiah said again to Ahaz,
<ASV> Be glad then, O heavens, and you who are in them. But there is trouble for the earth and the sea: because the Evil One has come down to you, being very angry, having the knowledge that he has but a short time.
<ASV> And Jacob went away secretly, without giving news of his flight to Laban the Aramaean.
<ASV> Then let the priest take cedar-wood and hyssop and red thread, and put them into the fire where the cow is burning.
<ASV> And the Lord said to him, What is that in your hand? And he said, A rod.
<ASV> Then he said to me, Come here to my side, and put me to death, for the pain of death has me in its grip but my life is still strong in me.
<ASV> So Haman came in. And the king said to him, What is to be done to the man whom the king has delight in honouring? Then the thought came into Haman's mind, Whom, more than myself, would the king have pleasure in honouring?
<ASV> For I am the Lord your God, who makes the sea calm when its waves are thundering: the Lord of armies is his name.
<ASV> And as for the vision which the king saw of a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven, saying, Let the tree be cut down and given to destruction;
<ASV> And they gave him worship and went back to Jerusalem with great joy.
<ASV> Take a drink, and I will get water for your camels; let her be the woman marked out by the Lord for my master's son.
<ASV> All this does the servant of my lord the king give to the king. And Araunah said, May the Lord your God be pleased with your offering!
<ASV> But even she has been taken away, she has gone away as a prisoner: even her young children are smashed to bits at the top of all the streets: the fate of her honoured men is put to the decision of chance, and all her great men are put in chains.
<ASV> And I gave the paper to Baruch, the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, before the eyes of Hanamel, the son of my father's brother, and of the witnesses who had put their names to the paper, and before all the Jews who were seated in the place of the armed watchmen.
<ASV> For this cause the Lord, the Lord of armies, says, O my people living in Zion, have no fear of the Assyrian, even if his rod comes on your back, and his stick is lifted up as in Egypt.
<ASV> Any man or woman who makes use of spirits, or who is a wonder-worker, is to be put to death: they are to be stoned with stones: their blood will be on them.
<ASV> For a sound of weeping goes up from Zion, a cry, How has destruction come on us? we are overcome with shame because we have gone away from our land; he has sent us out from our house.
<ASV> Then all the expert workmen among them made the House with its ten curtains; of the best linen, blue and purple and red, they made them, with winged ones worked by expert designers.
<ASV> One male of the goats for a sin-offering;
<ASV> Then he made the king's son come out, and put the crown on him and the arm-bands, and made him king, and put the holy oil on him; and they all, making sounds of joy with their hands, said, Long life to the king.
<ASV> For the word of the Lord is upright, and all his works are certain.
<ASV> Now the winged ones were stationed on the right side of the house when the man went in; and the inner square was full of the cloud.
<ASV> And say to him, Take care and be quiet; have no fear, and do not let your heart be feeble, because of these two ends of smoking fire-wood, because of the bitter wrath of Rezin and Aram, and of the son of Remaliah.
<ASV> For wisdom is better than jewels, and all things which may be desired are nothing in comparison with her.
<ASV> Do not keep back good from those who have a right to it, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.
<ASV> The Lord God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my birth, and made an oath to me, saying, To your seed I will give this land: he will send his angel before you and give you a wife for my son in that land.
<ASV> And once every year Aaron is to make its horns clean: with the blood of the sin-offering he is to make it clean once every year from generation to generation: it is most holy to the Lord.
<ASV> And the children of Israel were pleased about this; and they gave praise to God, and had no more thought of going to war against the children of Reuben and the children of Gad for the destruction of their land.
<ASV> And the children of Israel and Judah, who were living in the towns of Judah came with the tenth part of their oxen and sheep, and a tenth of all the holy things which were to be given to the Lord their God, and put them in great masses.
<ASV> The children of Bebai, six hundred and twenty-three.
<ASV> For this reason I will send the worst of the nations and they will take their houses for themselves: I will make the pride of their strength come to an end; and their holy places will be made unclean.
<ASV> And when the people saw that Aaron was dead, all the children of Israel gave themselves up to weeping for him for thirty days.
<ASV> And now, see, the Lord has put a spirit of deceit in the mouth of these prophets of yours; and the Lord has said evil against you.
<ASV> Their young ones are strong, living in the open country; they go out and do not come back again.
<ASV> All my desire has been for your salvation, O Lord; and your law is my delight.
<ASV> And now, I give you into the care of God and the word of his grace, which is able to make you strong and to give you your heritage among all the saints.
<ASV> And Nebo and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Sibmah: and they gave other names to the towns they made.
<ASV> Now when all these things have come on you, the blessing and the curse which I have put before you, if the thought of them comes back to your minds, when you are living among the nations where the Lord your God has sent you,
<ASV> And I saw the form of a man's hands among the winged ones under their wings.
<ASV> Now these are the kings of the land whom the children of Israel overcame, taking as their heritage their land on the east side of Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah to the east:
<ASV> You may get food for your needs from them for a price, and water for drinking.
<ASV> All those who are Israelites by birth are to do these things in this way, when giving an offering made by fire of a sweet smell to the Lord.
<ASV> And in addition they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who was living in Sodom, and all his goods.
<ASV> And be certain in your minds this day; for these words are not said to your children, who have had no experience of the training of the Lord your God, and who have not seen his great power or his strong hand and his stretched-out arm,
<ASV> For we are not like the great number who make use of the word of God for profit: but our words are true, as from God, being said as before God in Christ.
<ASV> And she said, Take a drink, my lord: and quickly letting down her vessel onto her hand, she gave him a drink.
<ASV> And now, my daughter, have no fear; I will do for you whatever you say: for it is clear to all my townspeople that you are a woman of virtue.
<ASV> In those days the family of Judah will go with the family of Israel, and they will come together out of the land of the north into the land which I gave for a heritage to your fathers.
<ASV> We are free to do all things, but there are things which it is not wise to do. We are free to do all things, but not all things are for the common good.
<ASV> They take what you give them; they are full of the good things which come from your open hand.
<ASV> And you will be searching for me and I will be there, when you have gone after me with all your heart.
<ASV> For I would be crushed by his storm, my wounds would be increased without cause.
<ASV> Violent acts will no longer be seen in your land, wasting or destruction in your limits; but your walls will be named, Salvation, and your doors Praise.
<ASV> Kings' daughters are among your noble women: on your right is the queen in gold of Ophir.
<ASV> All things have been given to me by my Father: and no one has knowledge of the Son, but only the Father: and of the Father, but only the Son, and he to whom the Son will make it clear.
<ASV> Whoever takes a man's life, by man will his life be taken; because God made man in his image.
<ASV> And they said to him, In Beth-lehem of Judaea; for so it is said in the writings of the prophet,
<ASV> And they made two gold frames and two gold rings, the rings being fixed to the ends of the priest's bag;
<ASV> My flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.
<ASV> So Joshua sent for the twelve men, whom he had ready, one man out of every tribe of the children of Israel,
<ASV> And I and all the people with me will come near the town, and when they come out against us as they did before, we will go in flight from them;
<ASV> See, your name is marked on my hands; your walls are ever before me.
<ASV> And they overcame all the towns round Gerar, because the Lord sent fear on them; and they took away their goods from the towns, for there were stores of wealth in them.
<ASV> But if punishment does come, it is sent by the Lord, so that we may be safe when the world is judged.
<ASV> And be working for the peace of the land to which I have had you taken away prisoners, and make prayer to the Lord for it: for in its peace you will have peace.

<ASV> Jesus said to them, Get some of the fish which you have now taken.
<ASV> You who have fear of the Lord, give him praise; all you seed of Jacob, give him glory; go in fear of him, all you seed of Israel.
<ASV> Waters were flowing over my head; I said, I am cut off.
<ASV> Now three days after, when they had made this agreement with them, they had word that these men were their neighbours, living near them.
<ASV> But as for you who have the name of Jew, and are resting on the law, and take pride in God,
<ASV> Let them be put to shame because they have done disgusting things. They had no shame, they were not able to become red with shame: so they will come down with those who are falling: in the time of their punishment they will be made low, says the Lord.
<ASV> The Lord is upright in all his ways, and kind in all his works.

<ASV> And Paul went down and, falling on him, took him in his arms and said, Do not be troubled, for his life is in him.
<ASV> They have put an end to my life in the prison, stoning me with stones.
<ASV> And those who were near said, Do you say such words against God's high priest?
<ASV> They say to him, We are able. He says to them, Truly, you will take of my cup: but to be seated at my right hand and at my left is not for me to give, but it is for those for whom my Father has made it ready.
<ASV> The Lord has said, See, I am changing the fate of the tents of Jacob, and I will have pity on his houses; the town will be put up on its hill, and the great houses will be living-places again.
<ASV> The son of Michael, the son of Baaseiah, the son of Malchijah,

<ASV> Jesus said to her, Your brother will come to life again.
<ASV> To the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely gave to us in the Loved One:
<ASV> To give punishment to those who have no knowledge of God, and to those who do not give ear to the good news of our Lord Jesus:
<ASV> So David gave praise to the Lord before all the people; and David said, Praise be to you, O Lord the God of Israel, our father for ever and ever.

<ASV> And ... without my flesh I will see God;
<ASV> Put up a pillar for Moab, for she will come to a complete end: and her towns will become a waste, without anyone living in them.
<ASV> Lifting up those who are low, and putting the sad in a safe place;

<ASV> Then the king went to his great house, and took no food that night, and no ... were placed before him, and his sleep went from him.
<ASV> Care in the heart of a man makes it weighted down, but a good word makes it glad.
<ASV> Then take a sharp-pointed instrument, driving it through his ear into the door, and he will be your servant for ever. And you may do the same for your servant-girl.

<ASV> Did I make a profit out of you by any of those whom I sent to you?
<ASV> Do they not say evil of the holy name which was given to you?
<ASV> And this is yours: the lifted offering which they give and all the wave offerings of the children of Israel I have given to you and to your sons and to your daughters as your right for ever: everyone in your house who is clean may have them for food.

<ASV> And I went on my face before his feet to give him worship. And he said to me, See you do it not: I am a brother-servant with you and with your brothers who keep the witness of Jesus: give worship to God: for the witness of Jesus is the spirit of the prophet's word.

<ASV> For you will not let my soul be in hell and you will not give up your Holy One to destruction.
<ASV> If a man gives his man-servant or his woman-servant a blow in the eye, causing its destruction, he is to let him go free on account of the damage to his eye.
<ASV> For this cause my thoughts are troubling me and driving me on.
<ASV> For if you do so, the wrath of the Lord will be burning against you, and the heaven will be shut up so that there is no rain and the land will give no fruit; and in a very little time you will be cut off from the good land which the Lord is giving you.
<ASV> Only the cattle we took for ourselves, with the goods from the towns we had taken.

<ASV> By their violent acts the evil-doers will be pulled away, because they have no desire to do what is right.
<ASV> So that we ourselves take pride in you in the churches of God for your untroubled mind and your faith in all the troubles and sorrows which you are going through;

<ASV> Who are resting on beds of ivory, stretched out on soft seats, feasting on lambs from the flock and young oxen from the cattle-house;

<ASV> Only those trees which you are certain are not used for food may be cut down and put to destruction: and you are to make walls of attack against the town till it is taken.

<ASV> Even then, in your great mercy, you did not give them up in the waste land: the pillar of cloud still went before them by day, guiding them on their way, and the pillar of fire by night, to give them light, and make clear the way they were to go.
<ASV> And they said, The Lord has need of him.
<ASV> All the people are to give this offering to the ruler.
<ASV> Pilate said, Am I a Jew? Your nation and the chief priests have given you into my hands: what have you done?

<ASV> He will have no respect for the gods of his fathers or for the god desired by women; he will have no respect for any god: for he will put himself on high over all.
<ASV> Even now will the taker of your heritage come to you, you who are living in Mareshah: the glory of Israel will come to destruction for ever.

<ASV> And Moses gave their heritage to the tribe of Reuben by their families.
<ASV> In their care are the ark, and the table, and the lights, and the altars, and all the vessels used in the holy place, and the veil, and all they are used for.
<ASV> This is what they are to make: a priest's bag, an ephod, and a robe, and a coat of coloured needlework, a head-dress, and a linen band; they are to make holy robes for Aaron your brother and for his sons, so that they may do the work of priests for me.
<ASV> Among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.

<ASV> Sennacherib, king of Assyria, says, In what are you placing your hope, waiting here in the walled town of Jerusalem?

<ASV> I did not send these prophets, but they went running: I said nothing to them, but they gave out the prophet's word.
<ASV> For the evil which overtakes them is the reward of their evil-doing: such men take their pleasure in the delights of the flesh even in the daytime; they are like the marks of a disease, like poisoned wounds among you, feasting together with you in joy;

<ASV> And I put it in writing, stamping it with my stamp, and I took witnesses and put the money into the scales.
<ASV> And over every living-place on Mount Zion, all over all her meetings, the Lord will make a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night, for over all, the glory of the Lord will be a cover and a tent;
<ASV> You are tall like a palm-tree, and your breasts are like the fruit of the vine.
<ASV> Because I am going to have the upright and the evil cut off from you, for this cause my sword will go out from its cover against all flesh from the south to the north:
<ASV> For see, I have made you small among the nations, looked down on by men.
<ASV> By evil-doing they will not get free from punishment. In wrath, O God, let the peoples be made low.
<ASV> And he said, Hagar, Sarai's servant, where have you come from and where are you going? And she said, I am running away from Sarai, my master's wife.
<ASV> And further, my son, take note of this: of the making of books there is no end, and much learning is a weariness to the flesh.
<ASV> Now Jacob had twelve sons: the sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's first son, and Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Zebulun;
<ASV> O daughter of Aroer, take your station by the way, on the watch: questioning him who is in flight, and her who has got away safe, say, What has been done?

<ASV> My dove, my very beautiful one, is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the dearest one of her who gave her birth. The daughters saw her, and gave her a blessing; yes, the queens and the servant-wives, and they gave her praises.
<ASV> Take care, then, to do whatever the Lord your God has given you orders to do; let there be no turning away to the right hand or to the left.
<ASV> I have come, not to get the upright, but sinners, so that they may be turned from their sins.

<ASV> The sun will not be your light by day, and the moon will no longer be bright for you by night: but the Lord will be to you an eternal light, and your God your glory.
<ASV> Who are glad with great joy, and full of delight when they come to their last resting-place;
<ASV> And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah;
<ASV> And of the Levites: Shemaiah, the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari;
<ASV> And he is to take off all its fat, burning it on the altar.
<ASV> But he who, without knowledge, did things for which punishment is given, will get only a small number of blows. The man to whom much is given, will have to give much; if much is given into his care, of him more will be requested.

<ASV> And after everything which has come on us because of our evil-doing and our great sin, and seeing that the punishment which you, O God, have given us, is less than the measure of our sins, and that you have kept from death those of us who are here;
<ASV> As we gave attention to Moses in all things, so we will give attention to you: and may the Lord your God be with you as he was with Moses.
<ASV> And all the kings of the earth came to see Solomon and to give ear to his wisdom, which God had put into his heart.

<ASV> And he put out Zedekiah's eyes; and the king of Babylon, chaining him in iron bands, took him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
<ASV> And when she got ready to take up the grain, Boaz gave his young men orders, saying, Let her take it even from among the cut grain, and say nothing to her.
<ASV> Because the work of the law is seen in their hearts, their sense of right and wrong giving witness to it, while their minds are at one time judging them and at another giving them approval;
<ASV> By mercy and good faith evil-doing is taken away: and by the fear of the Lord men are turned away from evil.
<ASV> My soul has no desire for such things, they are as disease in my food.
<ASV> And Jehu, the son of Hanani the seer, went to King Jehoshaphat and said to him, Is it right for you to go to the help of evil-doers, loving the haters of the Lord? because of this, the wrath of the Lord has come on you.

<ASV> If I say, Only let me be covered by the dark, and the light about me be night;
<ASV> O Lord, keep in mind how I have been true to you with all my heart, and have done what is good in your eyes. And Hezekiah gave way to bitter weeping.
<ASV> And Hashubah and Ohel and Berechiah and Hasadiah, Jushab-hesed, five.
<ASV> And he said to them, Go into the vine-garden with the others, and whatever is right I will give you. And they went to work.

<ASV> So Hezekiah went to rest with his fathers, and they put his body into the higher part of the resting-places of the sons of David: and all Judah and the people of Jerusalem gave him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son became king in his place.
<ASV> And do not give your bodies to sin as the instruments of wrongdoing, but give yourselves to God, as those who are living from the dead, and your bodies as instruments of righteousness to God.
<ASV> Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father who had love for us and has given us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,
<ASV> But as for you who have given up the Lord, who have no care for my holy mountain, who get ready a table for Chance, and make offerings of mixed wine to Fate;
<ASV> The seat of your kingdom is resting on righteousness and right judging: mercy and good faith come before your face.
<ASV> True teaching was in his mouth, and no evil was seen on his lips: he was walking with me in peace and righteousness, turning numbers of people away from evil-doing.
<ASV> In frequent travels, in dangers on rivers, in dangers from outlaws, in dangers from my countrymen, in dangers from the Gentiles, in dangers in the town, in dangers in the waste land, in dangers at sea, in dangers among false brothers;
<ASV> But if you put your heart right, stretching out your hands to him;
<ASV> And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian playing with Isaac.
<ASV> For you, Lord, are most high over the earth; you are lifted up over all other gods.
<ASV> Then Solomon said, O Lord, to the sun you have given the heaven for a living-place, but your living-place was not seen by men,
<ASV> And Shimei said, with curses, Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, you good-for-nothing:
<ASV> If then you take me to be your friend and brother, take him in as myself.
<ASV> And four great beasts came up from the sea, different one from another.
<ASV> And he went round and took the measure of it on the west side with the measuring rod, five hundred, measured with the rod all round.
<ASV> The king will give himself up to sorrow, and the ruler will be clothed with wonder, and the hands of the people of the land will be troubled: I will give them punishment for their ways, judging them as it is right for them to be judged; and they will be certain that I am the Lord.
<ASV> Their fruit will be cut off from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.
<ASV> And Og, king of Bashan: for his mercy is unchanging for ever:

<ASV> And you are to take one chief from every tribe to make the distribution of the land.
<ASV> And there is hope for the future, says the Lord; and your children will come back to the land which is theirs.
<ASV> The Lord is in his holy Temple, the Lord's seat is in heaven; his eyes are watching and testing the children of men.
<ASV> This is what the Lord has said: There will again be sounding in this place, of which you say, It is a waste, without man and without beast; even in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem which are waste and unpeopled, without man and without beast,
<ASV> Right and wrong, I say, not for you, but for the other man; for the fact that I am free is not dependent on another man's sense of right or wrong.
<ASV> Kings will give you offerings, they will come out of Egypt; from Pathros will come offerings of silver; Ethiopia will be stretching out her hands to God.
<ASV> For this reason the Lord, the God of armies, the God of Israel, has said, See, I will send on Judah and on all the people of Jerusalem all the evil which I said I would do to them: because I sent my words to them, but they did not give ear; crying out to them, but they gave no answer.
<ASV> And the children of Israel went through the sea on dry land: and the waters were a wall on their right side and on their left.
<ASV> If a man was desiring to go to law with him, he would not be able to give him an answer to one out of a thousand questions.
<ASV> In the day when God will be a judge of the secrets of men, as it says in the good news of which I am a preacher, through Jesus Christ.
<ASV> Though the Lord is high, he sees those who are low; and he has knowledge from far off of those who are lifted up.
<ASV> And if you say in your hearts, How are we to be certain that the word does not come from the Lord?
<ASV> And I went again in search of wisdom and of foolish ways. What may the man do who comes after the king? The thing which he has done before.
<ASV> Let his seed be cut off; in the coming generation let their name go out of memory.
<ASV> And they may not make common the holy things which the children of Israel give to the Lord,
<ASV> The cup of blessing which we take, does it not give us a part in the blood of Christ? and is not the broken bread a taking part in the body of Christ?
<ASV> Their tongues are sharp like the tongue of a snake; the poison of snakes is under their lips. (Selah.)
<ASV> Even the Spirit of true knowledge. That Spirit the world is not able to take to its heart because it sees him not and has no knowledge of him: but you have knowledge of him, because he is ever with you and will be in you.
<ASV> Have you knowledge of the rock-goats? or do you see the roes giving birth to their young?
<ASV> It is to be square, folded in two, a hand-stretch long and a hand-stretch wide.
<ASV> I have still much to say to you, but you are not strong enough for it now.
<ASV> Then I said to them, Whoever has any gold, let him take it off; so they gave it to me, and I put it in the fire, and this image of an ox came out.
<ASV> Yes, let all kings go down before him; let all nations be his servants.
<ASV> On him who has mercy you will have mercy; to the upright you will be upright;
<ASV> Is it possible for a man to be of profit to God? No, for a man's wisdom is only of profit to himself.
<ASV> For there was an order from the king about them and a regular amount for the music-makers, for their needs day by day.

<ASV> And it will be clear to the nations that the children of Israel were taken away prisoners for their evil-doing; because they did wrong against me, and my face was covered from them: so I gave them up into the hands of their attackers, and they all came to their end by the sword.
<ASV> Then they gave us great honour, and, when we went away, they put into the ship whatever things we were in need of.
<ASV> For it would have been better for them to have had no knowledge of the way of righteousness, than to go back again from the holy law which was given to them, after having knowledge of it.
<ASV> They keep on saying to those who have no respect for the word of the Lord, You will have peace; and to everyone who goes on his way in the pride of his heart, they say, No evil will come to you.
<ASV> Give attention to him and give ear to his voice; do not go against him; for your wrongdoing will not be overlooked by him, because my name is in him.
<ASV> Who made the rock into a water-spring, and the hard stone into a fountain.
<ASV> And he took the burned offering, offering it in the ordered way;
<ASV> For I am against the putting away of a wife, says the Lord, the God of Israel, and against him who is clothed with violent acts, says the Lord of armies: so give thought to your spirit and do not be false in your acts.
<ASV> And so I am ordering you to see that three towns are marked out for this purpose.
<ASV> And, A stone of falling, a rock of trouble; the word is the cause of their fall, because they go against it, and this was the purpose of God.
<ASV> Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, Let a pillar, fifty cubits high, be made ready for hanging him, and in the morning get the king to give orders for the hanging of Mordecai: then you will be able to go to the feast with the king with a glad heart. And Haman was pleased with the suggestion, and he had the pillar made.
<ASV> The Lord was looking down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any who had wisdom, searching after God.
<ASV> Let your circumcision be of the heart, and put away your pride.
<ASV> And from among yourselves will come men who will give wrong teaching, turning away the disciples after them.
<ASV> O Lord God of Israel, righteousness is yours; we are only a small band which has been kept from death, as at this day: see, we are before you in our sin; for no one may keep his place before you because of this.
<ASV> For this reason the children of Israel, even today, never take that muscle in the hollow of the leg as food, because the hollow of Jacob's leg was touched.
<ASV> See, I am against you, you who are living on the rock of the valley, says the Lord; you who say, Who will come down against us? or who will get into our houses?
<ASV> And they will be united in attacking the Philistines on the west, and together they will take the goods of the children of the east: their hand will be on Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon will be under their rule.
<ASV> In the Lord will all the seed of Israel get their rights, and they will give glory to him.
<ASV> And on the eighth day they came to see to the circumcision of the child, and they would have given him the name of Zacharias, his father's name;
<ASV> Keepers of sheep with their flocks will come to her; they will put up their tents round her; everyone will get food in his place.
<ASV> And when they had given them a great number of blows, they put them in prison, giving orders to the keeper of the prison to keep them safely:
<ASV> She was full of desire for the Assyrians, captains and rulers, her neighbours, clothed in blue, horsemen going on horses, all of them young men to be desired.
<ASV> And every day Mordecai took his walk before the square of the women's house, to see how Esther was and what would be done to her.
<ASV> And looking, I saw four wheels by the side of the winged ones, one wheel by the side of a winged one and another wheel by the side of another: and the wheels were like the colour of a beryl stone to the eye.
<ASV> Now this I say: The law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, does not put an end to the agreement made before by God, so as to make the undertaking without effect.
<ASV> Do not say sharp words to a man of pride, or he will have hate for you; make them clear to a wise man, and you will be dear to him.
<ASV> And Moses said, You say truly; I will not see your face again.
<ASV> Together with the towns marked out for the children of Ephraim in the heritage of Manasseh, all the towns with their unwalled places.
<ASV> And in any business needing wisdom and good sense, about which the king put questions to them, he saw that they were ten times better than all the wonder-workers and users of secret arts in all his kingdom.
<ASV> Then he took him in his arms and gave praise to God and said,
<ASV> The sons of Levi, heads of families, were recorded in the book of the histories, even till the days of Johanan, the son of Eliashib.
<ASV> In my trouble my voice went up to the Lord, and my cry to my God: my voice came to his hearing in his holy Temple, and my prayer came to his ears.
<ASV> For this cause give a parting offering to Moresheth-gath: the daughter of Achzib will be a deceit to the king of Israel.
<ASV> But my people did not give ear to my voice; Israel would have nothing to do with me.
<ASV> The people who went in the dark have seen a great light, and for those who were living in the land of the deepest night, the light is shining.
<ASV> The writing was seen by a number of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was put to death on the cross was near the town; and the writing was in Hebrew and Latin and Greek.
<ASV> The Lord gives me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean before him.
<ASV> Now that night the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying,
<ASV> He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Amaziah had done.
<ASV> For it is not right for a man to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
<ASV> The valued sons of Zion, whose price was the best gold, are looked on as vessels of earth, the work of the hands of the potter!
<ASV> And again take some of these and put them in the fire, burning them up in the fire; and say to all the children of Israel,
<ASV> And the Lord sent Nathan to David. And Nathan came to him and said, There were two men in the same town: one a man of great wealth, and the other a poor man.
<ASV> For it is my desire, brothers, that this secret may be clear to you, so that you may not have pride in your knowledge, that Israel has been made hard in part, till all the Gentiles have come in;
<ASV> And Stephen, while he was being stoned, made prayer to God, saying, Lord Jesus, take my spirit.
<ASV> He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, not turning away from the sin which Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, did and made Israel do.
<ASV> If they give ear to his voice, and do his word, then he gives them long life, and years full of pleasure.
<ASV> And he sent and had John's head cut off in the prison.
<ASV> Truly, this was the sin of your sister Sodom: pride, a full measure of food, and the comforts of wealth in peace, were seen in her and her daughters, and she gave no help to the poor or to those in need.
<ASV> Let no man have a false idea. If any man seems to himself to be wise among you, let him become foolish, so that he may be wise.
<ASV> He has made everything right in its time; but he has made their hearts without knowledge, so that man is unable to see the works of God, from the first to the last.
<ASV> One gold spoon of ten shekels, full of spice for burning;
<ASV> And fear came on him, and he said, This is a holy place; this is nothing less than the house of God and the doorway of heaven.
<ASV> Be angry without doing wrong; let not the sun go down on your wrath;
<ASV> Dogs have come round me: I am shut in by the band of evil-doers; they made wounds in my hands and feet.
<ASV> Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
<ASV> And fire came out from before the Lord, burning up the offering on the altar and the fat: and when all the people saw it, they gave a loud cry, falling down on their faces.
<ASV> But God gave him back to life, having made him free from the pains of death because it was not possible for him to be overcome by it.
<ASV> Now on the first day of the week, very early, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the place and saw that the stone had been taken away from it.
<ASV> And when news was given to me that a secret design was being made against the man, I sent him straight away to you, giving orders to those who are against him to make their statements before you.
<ASV> From the tribes of the children of Judah and the children of Simeon they gave these towns, listed here by name:
<ASV> When I see your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have put in their places;
<ASV> And the woman said, Why have you had such a thought about the people of God? (for in saying these very words the king has put himself in the wrong because he has not taken back the one whom he sent far away.)
<ASV> Now there was among the Pharisees a man named Nicodemus, who was one of the rulers of the Jews.
<ASV> And in the time of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his friends, sent a letter to Artaxerxes, king of Persia, writing it in the Aramaean writing and language.
<ASV> But so that it may not go farther among the people, let us put them in fear of punishment if they say anything in future in this name.
<ASV> And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
<ASV> Even as you have been ready, in part, to say that we are your glory, in the same way that you are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.
<ASV> And every bit of clothing, and anything made of leather or goats' hair or wood, you are to make clean.
<ASV> Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,
<ASV> And it will come about that in all the land, says the Lord, two parts of it will be cut off and come to an end; but the third will be still living there.
<ASV> Say to Aaron and his sons, These are the words of blessing which are to be used by you in blessing the children of Israel; say to them,
<ASV> If I made up their number, it would be more than the grains of sand; when I am awake, I am still with you.
<ASV> This is a true saying; and it is my desire that you may give certain witness about these things, so that those who have had faith in God may give attention to good works. These things are good and of profit to men;
<ASV> And God kept Noah in mind, and all the living things and the cattle which were with him in the ark: and God sent a wind over the earth, and the waters went down.
<ASV> If I say, I will put my grief out of mind, I will let my face be sad no longer and I will be bright;
<ASV> And they will come from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south, and take their places in the kingdom of God.
<ASV> Again he sent out other servants, with orders to say to the guests, See, I have made ready my feast: my oxen and my fat beasts have been put to death, and all things are ready: come to the feast.
<ASV> And on hearing their outcry and what they said I was very angry.
<ASV> Because you have said, I am in the hands of the Lord, the Most High is my safe resting-place;
<ASV> So that the people were full of wonder when they saw that those who had no voice were talking, the feeble were made strong, those whose bodies were broken had the power of walking, and the blind were able to see: and they gave glory to the God of Israel.
<ASV> But the open country round the town, and its unwalled places, they gave to Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, as his property.
<ASV> So that in all your land, which the Lord your God is giving you for your heritage, no man may be wrongly put to death, for which you will be responsible.
<ASV> But the children would not be controlled by me; they were not guided by my rules, and they did not keep and do my orders, which, if a man does them, will be life to him; and they had no respect for my Sabbaths: then I said I would let loose my passion on them to give full effect to my wrath against them in the waste land.
<ASV> You have been journeying round this mountain long enough: now go to the north;
<ASV> And the rest said, Let him be; let us see if Elijah will come to his help.
<ASV> But now you have a desire to put me to death, a man who has said to you what is true, as I had it from God: Abraham did not do that.
<ASV> So he put it before them, and they had a meal and there was more than enough, as the Lord had said.
<ASV> And he took me away in the Spirit into a waste land: and I saw a woman seated on a bright red beast, full of evil names, having seven heads and ten horns,
<ASV> This is what the Lord has said: A curse on the foolish prophets who go after the spirit which is in them and have seen nothing!
<ASV> And he who had had the one talent came and said, Lord, I had knowledge that you are a hard man, getting in grain where you have not put seed, and making profits for which you have done no work:
<ASV> For he overcame the Jews in public discussion, making clear from the holy Writings that the Christ was Jesus.
<ASV> Because it is said in the Writings, See, I am placing a keystone in Zion, of great and special value; and the man who has faith in him will not be put to shame.
<ASV> And I will be the judge, said God, of that nation which made them servants: and after that, they will come out and give me worship in this place.
<ASV> Their south limit was from the farthest part of the Salt Sea, from the inlet looking to the south:
<ASV> After him was Eleazar, the son of Dodai the Ahohite, one of the three great fighters, who was with David in Pas-dammim when the Philistines came together there for the fight; and when the men of Israel had gone in flight,
<ASV> And there were flames and voices and thunders; and there was a great earth-shock so that never, from the time when men were on the earth, had there been so great an earth-shock, so full of power.
<ASV> And when the men who were sent by John had gone away, he said to the people, about John, What did you go out into the waste land to see? a tall stem moving in the wind?
<ASV> Now after the death of their father, Joseph's brothers said to themselves, It may be that Joseph's heart will be turned against us, and he will give us punishment for all the evil which we did to him.
<ASV> In those days and in that time, says the Lord, when the evil-doing of Israel is looked for, there will be nothing; and in Judah no sins will be seen: for I will have forgiveness for those whom I will keep safe.
<ASV> And it will come about in that day that the prophets will be shamed, every man on account of his vision, when he is talking as a prophet; and they will not put on a robe of hair for purposes of deceit:
<ASV> (For if a man has not the art of ruling his house, how will he take care of the church of God?)
<ASV> Then the king of Assyria went through all the land and came up to Samaria, shutting it in with his forces for three years.
<ASV> Say to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin,
<ASV> And the angel, answering, said to me, These go out to the four winds of heaven from their place before the Lord of all the earth.
<ASV> But she came and gave him worship, saying, Help, Lord.
<ASV> And the children of Ammon came out and put their forces in position at the way into the town: and the Aramaeans of Zobah and of Rehob, with the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.
<ASV> And now, O Job, give ear to my words, and take note of all I say.
<ASV> And I said to their children in the waste land, Do not be guided by the rules of your fathers or keep their orders or make yourselves unclean with their images:
<ASV> For Adam was first formed, then Eve;
<ASV> For I say to you, If your righteousness is not greater than the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never go into the kingdom of heaven.
<ASV> And you will become a very small band, though your numbers were like the stars of heaven; because you did not give ear to the voice of the Lord your God.
<ASV> My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may be without sin. And if any man is a sinner, we have a friend and helper with the Father, Jesus Christ, the upright one:
<ASV> To the children of the east I have given her for a heritage, as well as the children of Ammon, so that there may be no memory of her among the nations:
<ASV> To see your power and your glory, as I have seen you in the holy place.
<ASV> Now, see, you will be without voice or language till the day when these things come about, because you had not faith in my words, which will have effect at the right time.
<ASV> And the children of Israel said to Moses, Truly, destruction has come on us; an evil fate has overtaken us all.
<ASV> All these were sons of Obed-edom: they and their sons and their brothers, able men and strong for the work; sixty-two sons of Obed-edom.
<ASV> And the families of scribes who were living at Jabez: the Tirathites, the Shimeathites, the Sucathites. These are the Kenites, the offspring of Hammath, the father of the family of Rechab.
<ASV> And the Lord said to Moses, How long will this people have no respect for me? how long will they be without faith, in the face of all the signs I have done among them?
<ASV> Then David the king went in and took his seat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my family, that you have been my guide till now?
<ASV> Then I will give up caring for the seed of Jacob and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will let their fate be changed and will have mercy on them.
<ASV> And the chief priest is to take some of its blood and take it to the Tent of meeting;
<ASV> So he put them in prison for three days.
<ASV> For the days are coming in which they will say, Happy are those who have had no children, whose bodies have never given birth, whose breasts have never given milk.
<ASV> Is not the Lord your God with you? and has he not given you rest on every side? for the Lord has given the people of the land into my hands, and the land is overcome before the Lord and before his people.
<ASV> But what comparison may I make of this generation? It is like children seated in the market-places, crying out to one another,
<ASV> Let me make a song about my loved one, a song of love for his vine-garden. My loved one had a vine-garden on a fertile hill:
<ASV> A saviour of others, he has no salvation for himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will have faith in him.
<ASV> And you are to keep the feast of weeks when you get in the first-fruits of the grain, and the feast at the turn of the year when you take in the produce of your fields.
<ASV> I will be glad and have delight in your mercy; because you have seen my trouble; you have had pity on my soul in its sorrows;
<ASV> Let your ear be turned to us, O Lord; let your eyes be open, O Lord, and see: take note of all the words of Sennacherib who has sent men to say evil against the living God.
<ASV> And it will be, that if you give attention to these decisions and keep and do them, then the Lord will keep his agreement with you and his mercy, as he said in his oath to your fathers.
<ASV> And when they say to you, Why are you making sounds of grief? then say, Because of the news, for it is coming: and every heart will become soft, and all hands will be feeble, and every spirit will be burning low, and all knees will be turned to water: see, it is coming and it will be done, says the Lord.
<ASV> Who made the Bear and Orion, and the Pleiades, and the store-houses of the south:
<ASV> Have the doors of death been open to you, or have the door-keepers of the dark ever seen you?
<ASV> So the workmen did their work, making good what was damaged and building up the house of God till it was strong and beautiful again.
<ASV> And the holy Writings were put into effect which said, And Abraham had faith in God and it was put to his account as righteousness; and he was named the friend of God.
<ASV> As for the earth, bread comes out of it; but under its face it is turned up as if by fire.
<ASV> A seat of glory, placed on high from the first, is our holy place.
<ASV> There is no help for your wound, there is nothing to make you well.
<ASV> And now, this is what I will do to my vine-garden: I will take away the circle of thorns round it, and it will be burned up; its wall will be broken down and the beasts of the field will go through it;
<ASV> Made an attempt to get a view of Jesus, and was not able to do so, because of the people, for he was a small man.
<ASV> And the seed which was put in good earth, this is he who gives ear to the word, and gets the sense of it; who gives fruit, some a hundred, some sixty, some thirty times as much.
<ASV> And turning my face to the Lord God, I gave myself up to prayer, requesting his grace, going without food, in haircloth and dust.
<ASV> And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he had made,
<ASV> For this reason the Lord has said: Your dead whom you have put down in its streets, they are the flesh, and this town is the cooking-pot: but I will make you come out from inside it.
<ASV> I am the good keeper; I have knowledge of my sheep, and they have knowledge of me,
<ASV> For this cause the Lord has said, See, I am against you, O Tyre, and will send up a number of nations against you as the sea sends up its waves.
<ASV> So the Lord sent fear on the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah; and the Ethiopians went in flight.
<ASV> The memory of the upright is a blessing, but the name of the evil-doer will be turned to dust.
<ASV> Even while I was still in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at first when my weariness was great, put his hand on me about the time of the evening offering.
<ASV> Now the man Moses was more gentle than any other man on earth.
<ASV> &lt;A Song of the going up.&gt; In my trouble my cry went up to the Lord, and he gave me an answer.
<ASV> And I will send on Elam four winds from the four quarters of heaven, driving them out to all those winds; there will be no nation into which the wanderers from Elam do not come.
<ASV> But what I do, that I will go on doing, so that I may give no chance to those who are looking for one; so that, in the cause of their pride, they may be seen to be the same as we are.
<ASV> At last our feet were inside your doors, O Jerusalem.
<ASV> To have let men from strange lands, without circumcision of heart or flesh, come into my holy place, making my house unclean; and to have made the offering of my food, even the fat and the blood; and in addition to all your disgusting ways, you have let my agreement be broken.
<ASV> This is what the Lord God let me see: and I saw that, when the growth of the late grass was starting, he made locusts; it was the late growth after the king's cutting was done.
<ASV> And his love to you is the more increased by his memory of you all, how you gave way to his authority, and how you took him to your hearts with fear and honour.
<ASV> How short is the life of your servant! when will you give your decision against those who are attacking me?
<ASV> And for the land of my people, where thorns will come up; even for all the houses of joy in the glad town.
<ASV> Every curtain is to be thirty cubits long and four cubits wide, all of the same measure.
<ASV> And these are the sons of Aaron: Eleazar his son, Phinehas his son, Abishua his son,
<ASV> Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<ASV> And he went down on his face before the king, and said, What is your servant, for you to take note of a dead dog such as I am?
<ASV> And the other disciples came in the little boat (they were not far from land, only about two hundred cubits off) pulling the net full of fish.
<ASV> Foolish man, it is necessary for the seed which you put into the earth to undergo death in order that it may come to life again:
<ASV> For it is our desire that you may not be without knowledge of our trouble which came on us in Asia, that the weight of it was very great, more than our power, so that it seemed that we had no hope even of life:
<ASV> And Elisha said, At this time in the coming year you will have a son in your arms. And she said, No, my lord, O man of God, do not say what is false to your servant.
<ASV> So this is what I will do to you, O Israel: and because I will do this to you, be ready for a meeting with your God, O Israel.
<ASV> Give one another the kiss of love. Peace be to you all in Christ.
<ASV> And he took me out into the outer square and made me go by the four angles of the square; and I saw that in every angle of the open square there was a space shut in.
<ASV> And being made free from sin you have been made the servants of righteousness.
<ASV> Now Jacob had word of what Shechem had done to his daughter; but his sons were in the fields with the cattle, and Jacob said nothing till they came.
<ASV> Give praise to the Lord, you his angels, who are great in strength, doing his orders, and waiting for his voice.
<ASV> Now Athaliah, hearing the noise of the people running and praising the king, came to the people in the house of the Lord:
<ASV> And the free giving has not the same effect as the sin of one: for the effect of one man's sin was punishment by the decision of God, but the free giving had power to give righteousness to wrongdoers in great number.
<ASV> And Abner sent men to David at Hebron, saying, Make an agreement with me, and I will give you my support in getting all Israel on your side.
<ASV> And they will be your children's heritage after you, to keep as their property; they will be your servants for ever; but you may not be hard masters to your countrymen, the children of Israel.
<ASV> I had almost given up my hope of seeing the blessing of the Lord in the land of the living.
<ASV> But Absalom went in flight. And the young man who kept the watch, lifting up his eyes, saw that a great band of people was coming down the slope by the way of the Horons; and the watchman came and gave word to the king, saying, I saw men coming down by the way of the Horons, from the hillside.
<ASV> Why are you questioning me? put questions to my hearers about what I have said to them: they have knowledge of what I said.
<ASV> And she took her rest at his feet till the morning: and she got up before it was light enough for one to see another. And he said, Let it not come to anyone's knowledge that the woman came to the grain-floor.
<ASV> When its branches are dry they will be broken off; the women will come and put fire to them: for it is a foolish people; for this cause he who made them will have no mercy on them, and he whose work they are will not have pity on them.
<ASV> And the people of the land are to give worship at the door of that doorway before the Lord on the Sabbaths and at the new moons.
<ASV> Then the word of the Lord came to Gad, David's seer, saying,
<ASV> Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah;
<ASV> And I will make a nation of the son of your servant-woman, because he is your seed.
<ASV> Light is shining on the lovers of righteousness, and for the upright in heart there is joy.
<ASV> But Balaam in answer said to Balak, Did I not say to you, I may only do what the Lord says?
<ASV> Has it not come to your ears how I did it long before, purposing it in times long past? Now I have given effect to my design, so that by you strong towns might be turned into masses of broken walls.
<ASV> Causing sin to come on him, then he will have to give back the thing he took by force or got by cruel acts, or the goods which were put in his care or the thing he came on by chance,
<ASV> But as for you and your servants, I am certain that even now the fear of the Lord God will not be in your hearts.
<ASV> And he said to me, Son of man, have you seen this? Then he took me to the river's edge.
<ASV> I will keep in mind the works of Jah: I will keep the memory of your wonders in the past.
<ASV> He has put out his hand against those who were at peace with him; he has not kept his agreement.
<ASV> If a man puts money or goods in the care of his neighbour to keep for him, and it is taken from the man's house, if they get the thief, he will have to make payment of twice the value.
<ASV> God is Spirit: then let his worshippers give him worship in the true way of the spirit.
<ASV> So that your hearts may not become feeble and full of fear because of the news which will go about in the land; for a story will go about one year, and after that in another year another story, and violent acts in the land, ruler against ruler.
<ASV> Solomon had a vine-garden at Baal-hamon; he let out the vine-garden to keepers; every one had to give a thousand bits of silver for its fruit.
<ASV> For God's purpose for us is not wrath, but salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
<ASV> Five curtains were joined together to make one group, and six curtains were joined together to make the other group.
<ASV> In the seventh year, Jehoiada made himself strong, and made an agreement with the captains of hundreds, Azariah, the son of Jeroham, Ishmael, the son of Jehohanan, Azariah, the son of Obed, Maaseiah, the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat, the son of Zichri.
<ASV> And we are conscious that all things are working together for good to those who have love for God, and have been marked out by his purpose.
<ASV> Because the Gentiles go in search of all these things: for your Father in heaven has knowledge that you have need of all these things:
<ASV> The iron-worker is heating the metal in the fire, giving it form with his hammers, and working on it with his strong arm: then for need of food his strength gives way, and for need of water he becomes feeble.
<ASV> And when they are made low, and crushed by trouble and sorrow,

<ASV> And that which went on the stones, this is he who, hearing the word, straight away takes it with joy;

<ASV> See, I will make the shade which has gone down on the steps of Ahaz with the sun, go back ten steps. So the shade went back the ten steps by which it had gone down.
<ASV> Much in every way: first of all because the words of God were given to them.
<ASV> This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: You women have said with your mouths, and with your hands you have done what you said, We will certainly give effect to the oaths we have made, to have perfumes burned to the queen of heaven and drink offerings drained out to her: then give effect to your oaths and do them.

<ASV> So the Lord has said, I will send evil on them, which they will not be able to get away from; and they will send up a cry for help to me, but I will not give ear to them.
<ASV> If I was glad at the trouble of my hater, and gave cries of joy when evil overtook him;
<ASV> Do no field-work and give to the Lord an offering made by fire.
<ASV> And I will make an agreement of peace with them: it will be an eternal agreement with them: and I will have mercy on them and make their numbers great, and will put my holy place among them for ever.

<ASV> And David came to his house at Jerusalem: and the king took the ten women to whom he had given the care of the house, and had them shut up, and gave them the necessaries of life, but did not go near them. So they were shut up till the day of their death, living as widows.
<ASV> And it came about that when he got near Beth-phage and Bethany by the mountain which is named the Mountain of Olives, he sent two of the disciples,

<ASV> For you are our glory and our joy.

<ASV> And all the people said they would do so, for it seemed right to them.
<ASV> Foolish behaviour is the heritage of the simple, but men of good sense are crowned with knowledge.

<ASV> The word about Tyre. Let a cry of sorrow go up, O ships of Tarshish, because your strong place is made waste; on the way back from the land of Kittim the news is given to them.

<ASV> You have given your mouth to evil, your tongue to words of deceit.
<ASV> But when you go without food, put oil on your head and make your face clean;

<ASV> Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, are they not recorded in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
<ASV> So that I went against them and sent them away into the land of their haters: if then the pride of their hearts is broken and they take the punishment of their sins,
<ASV> And at Tehaphnehes the day will become dark, when the yoke of Egypt is broken there, and the pride of her power comes to an end: as for her, she will be covered with a cloud, and her daughters will be taken away prisoners.
<ASV> Egypt will be a waste and Edom a land of destruction, because of the evil done to the children of Judah, because they have let blood be drained out in their land without cause.

<ASV> And your strength will be used up without profit; for your land will not give her increase and the trees of the field will not give their fruit.
<ASV> The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
<ASV> Do not make false decisions in questions of yard-sticks and weights and measures.
<ASV> But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, an olive-tree of the fields, were put in among them, and were given a part with them in the root by which the olive-tree is made fertile,

<ASV> And let us go up to Beth-el: and there I will make an altar to God, who gave me an answer in the day of my trouble, and was with me wherever I went.
<ASV> Of which not one of the rulers of this world had knowledge: for if they had, they would not have put the Lord of glory on the cross:
<ASV> Not as if we were able by ourselves to do anything for which we might take the credit; but our power comes from God;
<ASV> You will be covered by his feathers; under his wings you will be safe: his good faith will be your salvation.
<ASV> And they have put up the high places of the Baal, burning their sons in the fire; a thing which was not ordered by me, and it was never in my mind:

<ASV> And round to the south of the slope of Akrabbim, and on to Zin: and its direction will be south of Kadesh-barnea, and it will go as far as Hazar-addar and on to Azmon:
<ASV> Saying with a loud voice, Salvation to our God who is seated on the high seat, and to the Lamb.
<ASV> I was eyes to the blind, and feet to him who had no power of walking.
<ASV> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. So be it.
<ASV> Then his brother's wife is to come to him, before the responsible men of the town, and take his shoe off his foot, and put shame on him, and say, So let it be done to the man who will not take care of his brother's name.

<ASV> Do not take away the property of the poor man because he is poor, or be cruel to the crushed ones when they come before the judge:

<ASV> I would make clear the number of my steps, I would put it before him like a prince! The words of Job are ended.
<ASV> He whose right it is to give punishment for blood, may himself put to death the taker of life when he comes face to face with him.
<ASV> May Job be tested to the end, because his answers have been like those of evil men.
<ASV> And if he gives a lamb as his sin-offering, let it be a female without any mark;
<ASV> Because a most special spirit, and knowledge and reason and the power of reading dreams and unfolding dark sayings and answering hard questions, were seen to be in him, even in Daniel (named Belteshazzar by the king): now let Daniel be sent for, and he will make clear the sense of the writing.

<ASV> And they put his war-dress in the house of their gods, and put up his head in the house of Dagon.
<ASV> Being conscious that you have done no wrong; so that those who say evil things about your good way of life as Christians may be put to shame.
<ASV> And when they were about to go away from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah: having no knowledge of what he was saying.

<ASV> Who makes the loud voice of the sea quiet, and puts an end to the sound of its waves.
<ASV> And he said, I will go out and be a spirit of deceit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Your trick will have its effect on him: go out and do so.
<ASV> Let them give praise to the name of the Lord: for he gave the order, and they were made.

<ASV> Now after this Joash had a desire to put the house of the Lord into good order again;

<ASV> See, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be given into the hands of the chief priests and scribes; and they will give orders for him to be put to death,

<ASV> So this is what the Lord has said: See, I am giving this town into the hands of the Chaldaeans and into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon, and he will take it:

<ASV> Kedemoth and Mephaath with their grass-lands, four towns.
<ASV> I was angry with my people, I put shame on my heritage, and gave them into your hands: you had no mercy on them; you put a cruel yoke on those who were old;
<ASV> And from the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its grass-lands, the town where the taker of life might be safe, and Hammoth-dor and Kartan with their grass-lands, three towns.

<ASV> And let Aaron's name be placed on the rod of Levi: for there is to be one rod for the head of every family.

<ASV> And the sons of Ephraim: Shuthelah and Bered his son, and Tahath his son, and Eleadah his son, and Tahath his son,
<ASV> Truly, the stork in the heavens is conscious of her fixed times; the dove and the swallow and the crane keep to the times of their coming; but my people have no knowledge of the law of the Lord.
<ASV> For they are a nation without wisdom; there is no sense in them.

<ASV> Even to this hour we are without food, drink, and clothing, we are given blows and have no certain resting-place;
<ASV> And the sons of Eliab: Nemuel and Dathan and Abiram. These are the same Dathan and Abiram who had a place in the meeting of the people, who together with Korah made an outcry against Moses and Aaron and against the Lord:
<ASV> And the Lord said to Moses,
<ASV> And so the words of the prophets are made more certain; and it is well for you to give attention to them as to a light shining in a dark place, till the dawn comes and the morning star is seen in your hearts;
<ASV> And Hezekiah went to rest with his fathers; and Manasseh his son became king in his place.
<ASV> And Judah, turning their faces, saw that they were being attacked in front and at the back; and they gave a cry for help to the Lord, while the priests were sounding their horns.
<ASV> And I saw that the Levites had not been given what was needed for their support; so that the Levites and the music-makers, who did the work, had gone away, everyone to his field.
<ASV> In his doing wrong to a man in his cause, the Lord has no pleasure.
<ASV> And, in addition, anyone who goes into the house at any time, while it is shut up, will be unclean till evening.
<ASV> For from the day when I took the children of Israel up out of Egypt till this day, I have had no house, but have gone from place to place in a tent.
<ASV> And you may not have sex relations with a beast, making yourself unclean with it; and a woman may not give herself to a beast: it is an unnatural act.
<ASV> And wonder overcame them all, and they gave glory to God; and they were full of fear, saying, We have seen strange things today.
<ASV> All this came to King Nebuchadnezzar.
<ASV> I took my rest in sleep, and then again I was awake; for the Lord was my support.
<ASV> And all the family of Joseph, and his brothers and his father's people: only their little ones and their flocks and herds they did not take with them from the land of Goshen.
<ASV> For this cause say to them, This is what the Lord has said: I have made this saying come to an end, and it will no longer be used as a common saying in Israel; but say to them, The days are near, and the effect of every vision.
<ASV> And say before the Lord your God, I have taken all the holy things out of my house and have given them to the Levite, and the man from a strange land, and him who has no father, and the widow, as you have given me orders: I have kept in mind all your orders, in nothing have I gone against them:
<ASV> This is what you are to say to them: The gods who have not made the heavens and the earth will be cut off from the earth and from under the heavens.
<ASV> O Lord, how great is the number of your works! in wisdom you have made them all; the earth is full of the things you have made.
<ASV> So take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, a man from every tribe.
<ASV> Then loss will come on you like an outlaw, and your need like an armed man
<ASV> As the children of Esau did for me in Seir and the Moabites in Ar; till I have gone over Jordan into the land which the Lord our God is giving us.
<ASV> And out of the tribe of Asher, Mashal with its outskirts, and Abdon with its outskirts,
<ASV> She sees that her marketing is of profit to her: her light does not go out by night.
<ASV> So the law has been a servant to take us to Christ, so that we might have righteousness by faith.
<ASV> And you are to put up the veil under the hooks, and put inside it the ark of the law: the veil is to be a division between the holy place and the most holy.
<ASV> Then the captain whose arm was supporting the king said to the man of God, Even if the Lord made windows in heaven, would such a thing be possible? And he said, Your eyes will see it, but you will not have a taste of the food.
<ASV> And the man who takes away the goat for Azazel is to have his clothing washed and his body bathed in water and then he may come back to the tent-circle.
<ASV> But you would have nothing to do with the Holy and Upright One, and made request for a man of blood to be given to you,
<ASV> The sons of Eliphaz: Teman and Omar, Zephi and Gatam, Kenaz and Timna and Amalek.
<ASV> My son, do not make your heart hard against the Lord's teaching; do not be made angry by his training:
<ASV> They have hands without feeling, and feet without power of walking; and no sound comes from their throat.
<ASV> Who ever gave orders to him, or said to him, You have done wrong?
<ASV> The cords of death were round me, and the seas of evil put me in fear.
<ASV> And in Ziklag, and in Meconah and its daughter-towns,
<ASV> For the trader will not go back to the things for which he had his price, even while he is still living:
<ASV> He who is ever desiring wealth goes running after money, and does not see that need will come on him.
<ASV> Now in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem, because of their sin against the Lord,
<ASV> And two chains of the best gold, twisted like cords; and have the chains fixed on to the frames.
<ASV> He who keeps secret the secret of his friend, will get himself a name for good faith.
<ASV> And the Hivite and the Arkite and the Sinite,
<ASV> As for Ephraim, their glory will go in flight like a bird: there will be no birth and no one with child and no giving of life.
<ASV> So Joab got up and went to Geshur and came back again to Jerusalem with Absalom.
<ASV> May God give you the dew of heaven, and the good things of the earth, and grain and wine in full measure:
<ASV> And it came about, after a short time, that he went through town and country giving the good news of the kingdom of God, and with him were the twelve,
<ASV> Only in the Lord will Jacob overcome and be strong: together all those who were angry with him will be put to shame and come to destruction.
<ASV> Of which I was made a preacher, through that grace of God which was given to me in the measure of the working of his power.
<ASV> And Esau said, Truly, I am at the point of death: what profit is the birthright to me?
<ASV> He is full of strength before the sun, and his branches go out over his garden.
<ASV> And if a man has sex relations with his son's wife, the two of them are to be put to death: it is unnatural; their blood will be on them.
<ASV> And on the tenth day of this seventh month there will be a holy meeting; keep yourselves from pleasure, and do no sort of work;
<ASV> For as the body is one, and has a number of parts, and all the parts make one body, so is Christ.
<ASV> From on high he has sent fire into my bones, and it has overcome them: his net is stretched out for my feet, I am turned back by him; he has made me waste and feeble all the day.
<ASV> Now this is the second sign which Jesus did after he had come out of Judaea into Galilee.
<ASV> Though I am poor and in need, the Lord has me in mind; you are my help and my saviour; let there be no waiting, O my God.
<ASV> For if anyone has a cause at law against you, and you are going with him before the ruler, make an attempt, on the way, to come to an agreement with him, for if you do not, he may take you before the judge and the judge will give you up to the police, and they will put you in prison.
<ASV> As we were designed before by him for the position of sons to himself, through Jesus Christ, in the good pleasure of his purpose,
<ASV> Wound for wound, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; whatever damage he has done, so let it be done to him.
<ASV> But I say to you that everyone whose eyes are turned on a woman with desire has had connection with her in his heart.
<ASV> So Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house; and he was still there: and they went down on their faces before him.
<ASV> And he made towns for himself, and got together much property in flocks and herds: for God had given him great wealth.
<ASV> For this cause, I will let the side of Moab be uncovered, and his towns on every side, the glory of the land, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon and as far as Kiriathaim.
<ASV> Come to our help, Lord: let the king give ear to our cry.
<ASV> And when the Lord your God has given it into your hands, let every male in it be put to death without mercy.
<ASV> But we, my brothers, being away from you for a short time, in body but not in heart, had all the more desire to see your face;
<ASV> But their altars are to be overturned and their pillars broken and their images cut down:
<ASV> In the past, when Saul was king, it was you who went at the head of Israel when they went out or came in; and the Lord your God said to you, You are to be the keeper of my people Israel, and their ruler.
<ASV> And he went in to Hagar and she became with child, and when she saw that she was with child, she no longer had any respect for her master's wife.
<ASV> Put on your sword, make it ready at your side, O strong chief, with your glory and power.
<ASV> Then give ear from heaven, and let the sin of your people Israel have forgiveness, and take them back again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers.
<ASV> And the chief priests and the scribes were there, making statements against him violently.
<ASV> And he went out after him; and he was not certain if what was done by the angel was a fact, for it seemed to him that he was seeing a vision.
<ASV> And all the years of Kenan's life were nine hundred and ten; and he came to his end.
<ASV> For this reason I am full of the wrath of the Lord, I am tired of keeping it in: may it be let loose on the children in the street, and on the band of the young men together: for even the husband with his wife will be taken, the old man with him who is full of days.
<ASV> Then he said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? is it a small thing to the children of Judah that they do the disgusting things which they are doing here? for they have made the land full of violent behaviour, making me angry again and again: and see, they put the branch to my nose.
<ASV> And for the peace-offerings, two oxen, five male sheep, five he-goats, five he-lambs of the first year: this was the offering of Nahshon, the son of Amminadab.
<ASV> Give my love to Andronicus and Junia, my relations, who were in prison with me, who are noted among the Apostles, and who were in Christ before me.
<ASV> You have put our evil doings before you, our secret sins in the light of your face.
<ASV> In those days and in that time, says the Lord, the children of Israel will come, they and the children of Judah together; they will go on their way weeping and making prayer to the Lord their God.
<ASV> And they are not across the sea, for you to say, Who will go over the sea for us and give us news of them so that we may do them?
<ASV> Put them not to death, for so my people will keep the memory of them: let them be sent in all directions by your power; make them low, O Lord our saviour.
<ASV> And Reaiah, the son of Shobal, was the father of Jahath; and Jahath was the father of Ahumai and Lahad. These are the families of the Zorathites.
<ASV> And the priest will give orders for everything to be taken out of the house, before he goes in to see the disease, so that the things in the house may not become unclean; and then the priest is to go in to see the house;
<ASV> The children of Kiriath-arim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred and forty-three.
<ASV> Because of the sin of the land, its troubles are increased; but by a man of wisdom and knowledge they will be put out like a fire.
<ASV> Evil has made them with child, and they give birth to trouble; and the fruit of their body is shame for themselves.
<ASV> But even now, says the Lord, come back to me with all your heart, keeping from food, with weeping and with sorrow:
<ASV> For even if you had overcome all the army of the Chaldaeans fighting against you, and there were only wounded men among them, still they would get up, every man in his tent, and put this town on fire.
<ASV> Because of your servant David, do not give up your king.
<ASV> And the younger had a son and gave him the name Ben-ammi: from him come the children of Ammon to this day.
<ASV> Jesus made answer, I have said that I am he; if you are looking for me, let these men go away.
<ASV> And Beth-lebaoth and Sharuhen; thirteen towns with their unwalled places;
<ASV> The waters went fifteen cubits higher, till all the mountains were covered.
<ASV> And David became greater and greater; for the Lord, the God of armies, was with him.

<ASV> And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, Pharaoh's heart is unchanged; he will not let the people go.

<ASV> Let his kingdom be from sea to sea, from the River to the ends of the earth.
<ASV> Take note of the month of Abib and keep the Passover to the Lord your God: for in the month of Abib the Lord your God took you out of Egypt by night.
<ASV> (May he have the Lord's mercy in that day); and of all he did for me at Ephesus you have full knowledge.
<ASV> And if a man from another country is living with you, and has a desire to keep the Passover to the Lord, let all the males of his family undergo circumcision, and then let him come near and keep it; for he will then be as one of your people; but no one without circumcision may keep it.
<ASV> If he made his spirit come back to him, taking his breath into himself again,
<ASV> And for the daughter-towns with their fields, some of the men of Judah were living in Kiriath-arba and its daughter-towns, and in Dibon and its daughter-towns, and in Jekabzeel and its daughter-towns,
<ASV> Let that which is leavened be burned as a praise-offering, let the news of your free offerings be given out publicly; for this is pleasing to you, O children of Israel, says the Lord.
<ASV> The sons of Zilpah, Leah's servant: Gad and Asher; these are the sons whom Jacob had in Paddan-aram.
<ASV> Are not five sparrows given in exchange for two farthings? and God has every one of them in mind.

<ASV> And sent destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah, burning them up with fire as an example to those whose way of life might in the future be unpleasing to him;
<ASV> Then again the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
<ASV> And destruction came on a third part of the living things which were in the sea, and on a third part of the ships.
<ASV> And the covered way was on the side nearest the outer square; there were palm-trees on the uprights, on this side and on that: and there were eight steps going up to it.

<ASV> Every one of them has gone back; they are unclean: there is not one who does good, no, not one.
<ASV> And he is to put his hand on the head of the offering and put it to death for a sin-offering in the place where they put to death the burned offering.

<ASV> To them he has given knowledge of all the arts of the handworker, of the designer, and the expert workman; of the maker of needlework in blue and purple and red and the best linen, and of the maker of cloth; in all the arts of the designer and the trained workman they are expert.
<ASV> Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasu,
<ASV> And the heaven and the earth and all things in them were complete.
<ASV> But it was you, my equal, my guide, my well-loved friend.
<ASV> And the ostrich and the night-hawk and the sea-hawk, and birds of that sort;
<ASV> Still, let your heart be turned to the prayer of your servant and to his prayer for grace, O Lord my God, and give ear to the cry and the prayer which your servant makes before you;
<ASV> And in the morning, The weather will be bad today, for the sky is red and angry. You are able to see the face of heaven, but not the signs of the times.

<ASV> And Remeth and En-gannim and En-haddah and Beth-pazzez;
<ASV> Then he comes to the disciples; and says to them, Go on sleeping now, and take your rest: for the hour is come, and the Son of man is given into the hands of evil men.
<ASV> For you will go out with joy, and be guided in peace: the mountains and the hills will make melody before you, and all the trees of the fields will make sounds of joy.
<ASV> And when your eyes are lifted up to heaven, and you see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the army of heaven, do not let yourselves be moved to give them worship, or become the servants of what the Lord has given equally to all peoples under heaven.
<ASV> This comes from the Lord of armies, purposing wonders, and wise in all his acts.
<ASV> And the bases of the door-pillars were shaking at the sound of his cry, and the house was full of smoke.

<ASV> And all the years of Enoch's life were three hundred and sixty-five:
<ASV> The children of Arah, six hundred and fifty-two.
<ASV> (Because the soul of that upright man living among them was pained from day to day by seeing and hearing their crimes):
<ASV> He is wise in heart and great in strength: who ever made his face hard against him, and any good came of it?
<ASV> For whoever gets me gets life, and grace from the Lord will come to him.
<ASV> Looking, I saw that the fertile field was a waste, and all its towns were broken down before the Lord and before his burning wrath.

<ASV> Or the seven cakes of bread of the four thousand, and the number of baskets you took up?
<ASV> As a number of attempts have been made to put together in order an account of those events which took place among us,
<ASV> Because of this evil will come on you, which may not be turned away for any price: and trouble will overtake you, from which no money will give salvation: destruction will come on you suddenly, without your knowledge.
<ASV> Being conscious that our old man was put to death on the cross with him, so that the body of sin might be put away, and we might no longer be servants to sin.

<ASV> They come from a far country, from the farthest part of heaven, even the Lord and the instruments of his wrath, with destruction for all the land.

<ASV> So it was named Babel, because there the Lord took away the sense of all languages and from there the Lord sent them away over all the face of the earth.
<ASV> But Peter and John in answer said to them, It is for you to say if it is right in the eyes of God to give attention to you more than to God:
<ASV> (By the Sidonians, Hermon is named Sirion, and by the Amorites Shenir;)
<ASV> And Joram went to rest with his fathers and was put into the earth with his fathers in the town of David: and Ahaziah his son became king in his place.

<ASV> And for these, that is the priests, the holy offering is to be twenty-five thousand long to the north, ten thousand wide to the west, ten thousand wide to the east and twenty-five thousand long to the south; and the holy place of the Lord will be in the middle of it.

<ASV> My friends make sport of me; to God my eyes are weeping,
<ASV> And I will make children their chiefs, and foolish ones will have rule over them.
<ASV> Do not keep in mind against us the sins of our fathers; let your mercy come to us quickly, for we have been made very low.
<ASV> One gold spoon of ten shekels, full of spice;
<ASV> The number of burned offerings which the people took in was seventy oxen, a hundred male sheep, and two hundred lambs: all these were for burned offerings to the Lord.

<ASV> And if one person does wrong, without being conscious of it, then let him give a she-goat of the first year for a sin-offering.
<ASV> Then let him take her to the priest, offering for her the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal, without oil or perfume; for it is a meal offering of a bitter spirit, a meal offering keeping wrongdoing in mind.
<ASV> He who has no love has no knowledge of God, because God is love.
<ASV> And armies sent by him will take up their position and they will make unclean the holy place, even the strong place, and take away the regular burned offering and put in its place an unclean thing causing fear.
<ASV> A curse is on you! for you are like the resting-places of dead men, which are not seen, and men go walking over them without knowledge of it.
<ASV> The son of Jesus, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,
<ASV> And there was a great outcry: and some of the scribes on the side of the Pharisees got up and took part in the discussion, saying, We see no evil in this man: what if he has had a revelation from an angel or a spirit?
<ASV> A sound of fear is in his ears; in time of peace destruction will come on him:
<ASV> It is the desire of these men to be at peace with us; let them then go on living in this country and doing trade here, for the country is wide open before them; let us take their daughters as wives and let us give them our daughters.
<ASV> Then all the king's wise men came in: but they were not able to make out the writing or give the sense of it to the king.
<ASV> And because of this news, our hearts became like water, and there was no more spirit in any of us because of you; for the Lord your God is God in heaven on high and here on earth.
<ASV> They had seven hundred and thirty-six horses, two hundred and forty-five transport beasts,
<ASV> Before ever the silver cord is cut, or the vessel of gold is broken, or the pot is broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the water-hole;
<ASV> And David said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you put yourselves against me today? is it right for any man in Israel to be put to death today? for I am certain today that I am king in Israel.
<ASV> Happy are you when men give you a bad name, and are cruel to you, and say all evil things against you falsely, because of me.
<ASV> But anything which has a mark you may not give; it will not make you pleasing to the Lord.
<ASV> And you are to make them linen trousers, covering their bodies from the middle to the knee;
<ASV> Have you no memory of the evil-doing of your fathers, and the evil-doing of the kings of Judah, and the evil-doing of their wives, and the evil which you yourselves have done, and the evil which your wives have done, in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
<ASV> But have nothing to do with unclean and foolish stories. Give yourself training in religion:
<ASV> Uthai, the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the sons of Perez, the son of Judah.
<ASV> But you, O Lord, are on high for ever.
<ASV> But opening his house freely to guests; a lover of what is good, serious-minded, upright, holy, self-controlled;
<ASV> Going down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain, and on as far as the east side of the sea of Chinnereth:
<ASV> But flesh with the life-blood in it you may not take for food.
<ASV> And let seven Sabbaths of years be numbered to you, seven times seven years; even the days of seven Sabbaths of years, that is forty-nine years;
<ASV> And the priest will put blood on the altar of the Lord at the door of the Tent of meeting, burning the fat for a sweet smell to the Lord.

<ASV> I will give praise to the name of God with a song; I will give glory to him for what he has done.
<ASV> And I will do in you what I have not done and will not do again, because of all your disgusting ways.

<ASV> And the Lord gave into his hands Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with some of the vessels of the house of God; and he took them away into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he put the vessels into the store-house of his god.
<ASV> On the first day there is to be a holy meeting: you may do no sort of field-work:
<ASV> And old stores long kept will be your food, and you will take out the old because of the new;
<ASV> Then at the sound of your voice, the Lord will give an answer; at your cry he will say, Here am I. If you take away from among you the yoke, the putting out of the finger of shame, and the evil word;
<ASV> I have much to say about you and against you: but he who sent me is true and what he has said to me I say to the world.
<ASV> Even man has no knowledge of his time; like fishes taken in an evil net, or like birds taken by deceit, are the sons of men taken in an evil time when it comes suddenly on them.
<ASV> Now after a long time the lord of those servants comes, and makes up his account with them.
<ASV> As the living Father has sent me, and I have life because of the Father, even so he who takes me for his food will have life because of me.
<ASV> All a man's ways are clean to himself; but the Lord puts men's spirits into his scales.
<ASV> And Abishua and Naaman and Ahoah
<ASV> Then Daniel said in answer to the king, No wise men, or users of secret arts, or wonder-workers, or readers of signs, are able to make clear to the king the secret he is searching for;

<ASV> I then, the prisoner in the Lord, make this request from my heart, that you will see that your behaviour is a credit to the position which God's purpose has given you,
<ASV> Who will give a decision against us? It is Christ Jesus who not only was put to death, but came again from the dead, who is now at the right hand of God, taking our part.
<ASV> You will be food for the fire; your blood will be drained out in the land; there will be no more memory of you: for I the Lord have said it.
<ASV> And Attai was the father of Nathan, and Nathan was the father of Zabad,
<ASV> But if you give forgiveness to anyone, I do the same: for if I have given forgiveness for anything, I have done it because of you, in the person of Christ;
<ASV> O keep my soul, and take me out of danger: let me not be shamed, for I have put my faith in you.
<ASV> But when you give a feast, send for the poor and the blind and those who are broken in body:

<ASV> And all the people saw the cloud at the door of the Tent, and they went down on their faces, everyone at the door of his tent.
<ASV> Jerusalem and the towns of Judah and their kings and their princes, to make them a waste place, a cause of fear and surprise and a curse, as it is this day;
<ASV> And I came today to the water-spring, and I said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, if it is your purpose to give a good outcome to my journey,
<ASV> Let the war-carriage be yoked to the quick-running horse, you who are living in Lachish: she was the first cause of sin to the daughter of Zion; for the wrongdoings of Israel were seen in you.
<ASV> At the same time, Tattenai, ruler of the land across the river, and Shethar-bozenai, and their men, came to them and said, Who gave you orders to go on building this house and this wall?
<ASV> But after I am come back from the dead, I will go before you into Galilee.
<ASV> And let the people keep the man responsible for the death safe from the hands of him who has the right of punishment for blood, and send him back to his safe town where he had gone in flight: there let him be till the death of the high priest who was marked with the holy oil.
<ASV> Now I am glad, not that you had sorrow, but that your sorrow was the cause of a change of heart; for yours was a holy sorrow so that you might undergo no loss by us in anything.
<ASV> An end has come, the end has come; see, it is coming on you.

<ASV> And further, in those days the chiefs of Judah sent a number of letters to Tobiah, and his letters came to them.
<ASV> For when it came to their ears, men said that I was truly happy; and when their eyes saw, they gave witness to me;
<ASV> For this is the word of him who is high and lifted up, whose resting-place is eternal, whose name is Holy: my resting-place is in the high and holy place, and with him who is crushed and poor in spirit, to give life to the spirit of the poor, and to make strong the heart of the crushed.
<ASV> Have you no fear of me? says the Lord; will you not be shaking with fear before me, who have put the sand as a limit for the sea, by an eternal order, so that it may not go past it? and though it is ever in motion, it is not able to have its way; though the sound of its waves is loud, they are not able to go past it.

<ASV> The law and the rule are to be the same for you and for those from other lands living with you.
<ASV> I was laughing at them when they had no hope, and the light of my face was never clouded by their fear.
<ASV> For if anyone comes preaching another Jesus from the one whose preachers we are, or if you have got a different spirit, or a different sort of good news from those which came to you, how well you put up with these things.
<ASV> So that now, on the other hand, it is right for him to have forgiveness and comfort from you, for fear that his sorrow may be over-great.
<ASV> And in the public places of her towns will be sorrow and weeping; and she will be seated on the earth, waste and uncovered.

<ASV> The fifteenth Jeremoth, with his sons and his brothers, twelve;
<ASV> So now, make a change for the better in your ways and your doings, and give ear to the voice of the Lord your God; then the Lord will let himself be turned from the decision he has made against you for evil.
<ASV> But if we were true judges of ourselves, punishment would not come on us.
<ASV> On the fifth day of the month, in the fifth year after King Jehoiachin had been made a prisoner,

<ASV> Your wealth being increased in everything, with a simple mind, causing praise to God through us.
<ASV> I have given my love to the Lord, because he has given ear to the voice of my cry and my prayer.

<ASV> The hater of work will not do his ploughing because of the winter; so at the time of grain-cutting he will be requesting food and will get nothing.
<ASV> And Beriah and Shema, who were heads of the families of those who were living in Aijalon, who put to flight the people living in Gath;
<ASV> You will have food, but not enough; your shame will be ever with you: you will get your goods moved, but you will not take them away safely; and what you do take away I will give to the sword.
<ASV> For this cause say to them, These are the words of the Lord: Every man of Israel who has taken his false god into his heart, and put before his face the sin which is the cause of his fall, and comes to the prophet; I the Lord will give him an answer by myself in agreement with the number of his false gods;

<ASV> Because this widow is a trouble to me, I will give her her right; for if not, I will be completely tired out by her frequent coming.
<ASV> They say, If a man puts away his wife and she goes from him and becomes another man's, will he go back to her again? will not that land have been made unclean? but though you have been acting like a loose woman with a number of lovers, will you now come back to me? says the Lord.
<ASV> Pain is sent on him as a punishment, while he is on his bed; there is no end to the trouble in his bones;

<ASV> And they do not say in their hearts, Now let us give worship to our God, who gives the rain, the winter and the spring rain, at the right time; who keeps for us the ordered weeks of the grain-cutting.
<ASV> Make songs to the Lord, all the earth; give the good news of his salvation day by day.

<ASV> And of the sons of Adin, Ebed, the son of Jonathan; and with him fifty males.
<ASV> And he made four gold rings, and put the rings at the angles of its four feet.

<ASV> And if you will not let them go, see, I will send frogs into every part of your land:
<ASV> And my hand will again be on you, washing away what is unclean as with soap, and taking away all your false metal;

<ASV> So the Rab-shakeh went back, and when he got there the king of Assyria was making war against Libnah, for it had come to his ears that he had gone away from Lachish.

<ASV> Come back, O children who are turned away, says the Lord; for I am a husband to you, and I will take you, one from a town and two from a family, and will make you come to Zion;
<ASV> Let all those who take pleasure in my troubles be shamed and come to nothing: let those who are lifted up against me be covered with shame and have no honour.
<ASV> All this has come on us, but still we have kept you in our memory; and we have not been false to your word.
<ASV> So that you might take it to its limit, guiding it to its house?

<ASV> May the Lord give you and your children still greater increase.
<ASV> You are the daughter of your mother whose soul is turned in disgust from her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters who were turned in disgust from their husbands and their children: your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.
<ASV> But they gave no attention, and their ears were not open so that they might be turned from their evil-doing and from burning perfume to other gods.

<ASV> My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes take delight in my ways.
<ASV> Through Phinehas, and because of his passion for my honour, my wrath has been turned away from the children of Israel, so that I have not sent destruction on them all in my wrath.

<ASV> &lt;Maschil. Of Asaph.&gt; Give ear, O my people, to my law; let your ears be bent down to the words of my mouth.

<ASV> And the Lord said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, You are a stiff-necked people: if I come among you, even for a minute, I will send destruction on you; so take off all your ornaments, so that I may see what to do with you.

<ASV> Son of man, what is the vine-tree more than any branching tree which is among the trees of the woods?
<ASV> Of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;

<ASV> And the fish in the Nile will come to destruction, and the river will send up a bad smell, and the Egyptians will not be able, for disgust, to make use of the water of the Nile for drinking.
<ASV> And when the beasts give glory and honour to him who is seated on the high seat, to him who is living for ever and ever,
<ASV> But their worship is to no purpose, while they give as their teaching the rules of men.
<ASV> Give my love to Prisca and Aquila and those of the house of Onesiphorus.
<ASV> Now when David had come to Mahanaim, Shobi, the son of Nahash of Rabbah, the Ammonite, and Machir, the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
<ASV> She became the mother of Zimran and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and Ishbak and Shuah.
<ASV> This is what I have seen: it is good and fair for a man to take meat and drink and to have joy in all his work under the sun, all the days of his life which God has given him; that is his reward.
<ASV> All was handed over by number and by weight: and the weight was put on record at that time.
<ASV> And the four and twenty rulers and the four beasts went down on their faces and gave worship to God who was seated on the high seat, saying, Even so, praise to the Lord.
<ASV> And the Gentiles, hearing this, were glad and gave glory to the word of God: and those marked out by God for eternal life had faith.
<ASV> And give to the Lord a burned offering for a sweet smell; one ox, one male sheep, seven he-lambs of the first year: only those without any mark on them may be used:
<ASV> By you their backs are turned in flight, so that my haters are cut off.
<ASV> Then let Aaron come into the Tent of meeting and take off the linen clothing which he put on when he went into the holy place, and put them down there;
<ASV> So righteousness gives life; but he who goes after evil gets death for himself.
<ASV> Now if the good news says that Christ came back from the dead, how do some of you say that there is no coming back from the dead?
<ASV> And when they saw him they were surprised, and his mother said to him, Son, why have you done this to us? see, your father and I have been looking for you with sorrow.
<ASV> And any clothing of wool or of linen in which is the mark of the disease;
<ASV> Let not your heart be troubled: have faith in God and have faith in me.
<ASV> On a ten-corded instrument, and on an instrument of music with a quiet sound.
<ASV> For now, truly, the cry of the children of Israel has come to me, and I have seen the cruel behaviour of the Egyptians to them.
<ASV> I have made myself tired to no purpose: still all the waste which is in her has not come out, it has an evil smell.
<ASV> And said to them, You are not to let these prisoners come here; for what you are designing to do will be a cause of sin against the Lord to us, making even greater our sin and our wrongdoing, which now are great enough, and his wrath is burning against Israel.
<ASV> Your help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
<ASV> Let Aaron come into the holy place in this way: with an ox for a sin-offering and a male sheep for a burned offering.
<ASV> So the king of Israel sent to the place where the man of God had said there was danger, and kept clear of it more than once.
<ASV> See, the things said before have come about, and now I give word of new things: before they come I give you news of them.
<ASV> These are the words of the Lord: See, I will send evil on this place and on its people, even everything which the king of Judah has been reading in the book;
<ASV> And in this mountain he will put an end to the shade covering the face of all peoples, and the veil which is stretched over all nations.
<ASV> And the Egyptians will see that I am the Lord, when I get honour over Pharaoh and his war-carriages and his horsemen.
<ASV> And the third heritage came out for Zebulun by their families; the limit of their heritage was as far as Sarid;
<ASV> Truly I say to you, The man whose ears are open to my word and who has faith in him who sent me, has eternal life; he will not be judged, but has come from death into life.
<ASV> His sons and his sons' sons, his daughters and his daughters' sons and all his family he took with him into Egypt.
<ASV> And the sons of Pedaiah: Zerubbabel and Shimei; and the sons of Zerubbabel: Meshullam and Hananiah; and Shelomith was their sister;
<ASV> And this is the offering you are to take from them: gold and silver and brass;
<ASV> Now Isaac's words to his son were said in Rebekah's hearing. Then Esau went out to get the meat.
<ASV> And gold by weight for the tables for the holy bread for every table, and silver for the silver tables;
<ASV> I have sent disease among you, as it was in Egypt: I have put your young men to the sword, and have taken away your horses; I have made the evil smell from your tents come up to your noses: and still you have not come back to me, says the Lord.
<ASV> How he was taken up into Paradise, and words came to his ears which may not be said, and which man is not able to say.
<ASV> For this cause, as the waste of the grain is burned up by tongues of fire, and as the dry grass goes down before the flame, so their root will be like the dry stems of grain, and their flower will go up in dust: because they have gone against the law of the Lord of armies, and have given no honour to the word of the Holy One of Israel.
<ASV> How then may you put to shame the least of my master's servants? and you have put your hope in Egypt for war-carriages and horsemen:
<ASV> If then I had such a purpose, did I seem to be changing suddenly? or am I guided in my purposes by the flesh, saying, Yes, today, and, No, tomorrow?
<ASV> Lord, you have put joy in my heart, more than they have when their grain and their wine are increased.
<ASV> And he himself made priests for the high places, and for the images of he-goats and oxen which he had made.
<ASV> Give thought to what I say; for the Lord will give you wisdom in all things.
<ASV> For the Lord of armies, by whom you were planted, has given his decision for evil against you, because of the evil which the people of Israel and the people of Judah have done, In moving me to wrath by offering perfumes to the Baal.
<ASV> Looking for the glad hope, the revelation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ;
<ASV> And Shaaraim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen towns with their unwalled places.
<ASV> The vision of Obadiah. This is what the Lord has said about Edom: We have had word from the Lord, and a representative has been sent among the nations, saying, Up! and let us make war against her.
<ASV> And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, Nahor's wife.
<ASV> Your ox will be put to death before your eyes, but its flesh will not be your food: your ass will be violently taken away before your face, and will not be given back to you: your sheep will be given to your haters, and there will be no saviour for you.
<ASV> Let me not be covered by the flowing waters; let not the deep waters go over my head, and let me not be shut up in the underworld.
<ASV> Go back quickly to the place you came from: it was my purpose to give you a place of honour, but now the Lord has kept you back from honour.
<ASV> And their wings were separate at the top; two of the wings of every one were joined one to another, and two were covering their bodies.

<ASV> But in the last days it will come about that the mountain of the Lord's house will be placed on the top of the mountains, and be lifted up over the hills; and peoples will be flowing to it.
<ASV> For truly, we who are in this tent do give out cries of weariness, for the weight of care which is on us; not because we are desiring to be free from the body, but so that we may have our new body, and death may be overcome by life.
<ASV> Then they readily took him into the boat: and straight away the boat was at the land to which they were going.
<ASV> Lord, where are your earlier mercies? where is the oath which you made to David in unchanging faith?
<ASV> When the morning stars made songs together, and all the sons of the gods gave cries of joy?
<ASV> Even the ox has knowledge of its owner, and the ass of the place where its master puts its food: but Israel has no knowledge, my people give no thought to me.
<ASV> And she was with child again, and gave birth to a son; and said, Now at last my husband will be united to me, because I have given him three sons: so he was named Levi.
<ASV> And so all Israel will get salvation: as it is said in the holy Writings, There will come out of Zion the One who makes free; by him wrongdoing will be taken away from Jacob:
<ASV> All who have knowledge of you among the peoples will be overcome with wonder at you: you have become a thing of fear, and you will never be seen again.
<ASV> Her husband is a man of note in the public place, when he takes his seat among the responsible men of the land.
<ASV> Then Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves and let him be judged by your law. But the Jews said to him, We have no right to put any man to death.

<ASV> Like an archer wounding all who go by, is a foolish man overcome by drink.
<ASV> And, in fact, she is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife:
<ASV> When evil things are said about us we give gentle answers: we are made as the unclean things of the world, as that for which no one has any use, even till now.

<ASV> Then Hilkiah, the chief priest, said to Shaphan the scribe, I have made discovery of the book of the law in the house of the Lord. So Hilkiah gave it to Shaphan;
<ASV> Come together, all of you, and give ear; who among you has given news of these things? the Lord's loved one will do his pleasure with Babylon, and with the seed of the Chaldaeans.
<ASV> And all the people went away to take food and drink, and to send food to others, and to be glad, because the words which were said to them had been made clear.

<ASV> And these were those who had the ordering of the music and songs, heads of families of the Levites, who were living in the rooms, and were free from other work, for their work went on day and night.
<ASV> And the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the Temple which was in Jerusalem, and put into the house of his god in Babylon, these Cyrus the king took from the house of his god in Babylon, and gave to one named Sheshbazzar, whom he had made ruler;

<ASV> And for me, that words may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make clear without fear the secret of the good news,

<ASV> Then I came to those who had been taken away as prisoners, who were at Telabib by the river Chebar, and I was seated among them full of wonder for seven days.
<ASV> You have said, It is no use worshipping God: what profit have we had from keeping his orders, and going in clothing of sorrow before the Lord of armies?
<ASV> How frequently are they as dry stems before the wind, or as grass taken away by the storm-wind?
<ASV> Because Aram has made evil designs against you, saying,
<ASV> Happy are you who are planting seed by all the waters, and sending out the ox and the ass.
<ASV> What is to be done by law to Vashti the queen, because she has not done what King Ahasuerus, by his servants, gave her orders to do?

<ASV> The earth will be moving uncertainly, like a man overcome by drink; it will be shaking like a tent; and the weight of its sin will be on it, crushing it down so that it will not get up again.
<ASV> Who will give to every man his right reward:
<ASV> The Father is not the judge of men, but he has given all decisions into the hands of the Son;
<ASV> If you come back to the Ruler of all, making yourself low before him; if you put evil far away from your tents;
<ASV> And the blood will be a sign on the houses where you are: when I see the blood I will go over you, and no evil will come on you for your destruction, when my hand is on the land of Egypt.

<ASV> Seven thousand, one hundred of the children of Simeon, great men of war;
<ASV> Even these I will give up into the hands of their haters and into the hands of those who have designs against their lives: and their dead bodies will become food for the birds of heaven and the beasts of the earth.
<ASV> And I said to them, We have given whatever we were able to give, to make our brothers the Jews free, who were servants and prisoners of the nations: and would you now give up your brothers for a price, and are they to become our property? Then they said nothing, answering not a word.
<ASV> For the Jews who were in Shushan came together again on the fourteenth day of the month Adar and put to death three hundred men in Shushan; but they put not a hand on their goods.

<ASV> For this reason they are full of bread; and water is ever flowing for them.
<ASV> Reuben, you are my oldest son, the first-fruit of my strength, first in pride and first in power:
<ASV> Give thought to the flowers: they do no work, they make no thread; and still I say to you, Even Solomon, in all his glory, was not clothed like one of these.
<ASV> And they will go wandering from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, running here and there in search of the word of the Lord, and they will not get it.

<ASV> And those who do evil against the agreement will be turned to sin by his fair words: but the people who have knowledge of their God will be strong and do well.

<ASV> He who keeps himself separate for his private purpose goes against all good sense.
<ASV> Yes, by my hand was the earth placed on its base, and by my right hand the heavens were stretched out; at my word they take up their places.
<ASV> For this is what the Lord has said about the family of the king of Judah: You are Gilead to me, and the top of Lebanon: but, truly, I will make you waste, with towns unpeopled.

<ASV> And the land which was waste will be farmed, in place of being a waste in the eyes of everyone who went by.
<ASV> The hands of the witnesses will be the first to put him to death, and after them the hands of all the people. So you are to put away the evil from among you.

<ASV> See, the rock was cut open by his power, so that the water came rushing out, and overflowing streams; is he able to give us bread? is he able to get meat for his people?
<ASV> Looking down on the heavens, and on the earth?
<ASV> And it came about in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
<ASV> The wise man, fearing, keeps himself from evil; but the foolish man goes on in his pride, with no thought of danger.
<ASV> Before I was in trouble I went out of the way; but now I keep your word.
<ASV> And the rest, in measure as long as the holy offering, will be ten thousand to the east and ten thousand to the west: and its produce will be for food for the workers of the town.

<ASV> Then five of you will put to flight a hundred, and a hundred of you will put to flight ten thousand, and all who are against you will be put to death by your swords.

<ASV> And their children were talking half in the language of Ashdod; they had no knowledge of the Jews' language, but made use of the language of the two peoples.
<ASV> If only he would be pleased to put an end to me; and would let loose his hand, so that I might be cut off!
<ASV> He who does not put out his money at interest, or for payment give false decisions against men who have done no wrong. He who does these things will never be moved.
<ASV> Put these in a basket and take them, with the ox and the two sheep.
<ASV> As it is said in the holy Writings, Because of you we are put to death every day; we are like sheep ready for destruction.
<ASV> The Lord, the Lord of armies, says, Go to this person in authority, this Shebna, who is over the house; who has made himself a resting-place on high, cutting out a place for himself in the rock, and say,
<ASV> He who goes on his way uprightly, doing righteousness, and saying what is true in his heart;
<ASV> So now, if it seems good to the king, let search be made in the king's store-house at Babylon, to see if it is true that an order was given by Cyrus the king for the building of this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send us word of his pleasure in connection with this business.

<ASV> And Jehoash, king of Israel, sent to Amaziah, king of Judah, saying, The thorn-tree in Lebanon sent to the cedar in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son for a wife: and a beast from the woodland in Lebanon went by, crushing the thorn under his feet.

<ASV> Then Pharaoh sent for the wise men and the wonder-workers, and they, the wonder-workers of Egypt, did the same with their secret arts.
<ASV> At that point the disciples came back, and they were surprised to see him talking to a woman; but not one of them said to him, What is your purpose? or, Why are you talking to her?
<ASV> The men of Beth-el and Ai, a hundred and twenty-three.
<ASV> Give attention with care to my words; and let this be your comfort.
<ASV> Thirty gold basins, four hundred and ten silver basins, and a thousand other vessels.
<ASV> And these are the words which you will say before the Lord your God: My father was a wandering Aramaean, and he went down with a small number of people into Egypt; there he became a great and strong nation:
<ASV> Will a man take food which has no taste without salt? or is there any taste in the soft substance of purslain?
<ASV> His offering was one silver plate, a hundred and thirty shekels in weight, one silver basin of seventy shekels, by the scale of the holy place; the two of them full of the best meal mixed with oil for a meal offering;
<ASV> And the sons of Lotan: Hori and Homam; and Timna was Lotan's sister.
<ASV> For they are saying to you what is false in my name: I have not sent them, says the Lord.

<ASV> And he took of the wine of it and was overcome by drink; and he was uncovered in his tent.
<ASV> And word of this was given to David; and he got all Israel together and went over Jordan and came to Helam and put his forces in position against them. And when David's forces were in position against the Aramaeans, the fight was started.
<ASV> The second Trouble is past: see, the third Trouble comes quickly.

<ASV> And it goes out from Beth-el to Luz, and on as far as the limit of the Archites to Ataroth;
<ASV> Cursed is he who does not give honour to his father or mother. And let all the people say, So be it.
<ASV> The Lord gave a true oath to David, which he will not take back, saying, I will give your kingdom to the fruit of your body.
<ASV> Then said the Lord, This man will not get the heritage, but a son of your body will have your property after you.

<ASV> And Moses said to the Lord, Why have you done me this evil? and why have I not grace in your eyes, that you have put on me the care of all this people?
<ASV> Then if the priest sees that the growth of the disease has become red and white on his head or on his brow where there is no hair, like the mark in the skin of a leper;
<ASV> Give me a little more time, and I will make it clear to you; for I have still something to say for God.
<ASV> Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the purpose of God, and Timothy the brother, to the church of God which is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia:
<ASV> Take part in the joy of those who are glad, and in the grief of those who are sorrowing.

<ASV> And now, give ear, O our God, to the prayer of your servant and to his request for grace, and let your face be shining on your holy place which is made waste, because of your servants, O Lord.

<ASV> And will go out to put in error the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to get them together to the war, the number of whom is like the sands of the sea.
<ASV> See, I am against the prophets, says the Lord, who let their tongues say, He has said.

<ASV> But he who goes through to the end will get salvation.
<ASV> The children of the door-keepers: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of Hatita, the children of Shobai, a hundred and thirty-nine.

<ASV> And he took a broken bit of a pot, and, seated in the dust, was rubbing himself with the sharp edge of it.

<ASV> And I gave orders for all the wise men of Babylon to come in before me so that they might make clear to me the sense of my dream.
<ASV> But they will go no farther: for their foolish behaviour will be clear to all men, as theirs was in the end.
<ASV> Then Joram said, Make ready. So they made his carriage ready; and Joram, king of Israel, with Ahaziah, king of Judah, went out in their carriages for the purpose of meeting Jehu; and they came face to face with him at the field of Naboth the Jezreelite.

<ASV> Now, truly, the Lord will send a great destruction on your people and your children and your wives and everything which is yours:
<ASV> Now while Moses' hand was lifted up, Israel was the stronger: but when he let his hand go down, Amalek became the stronger.
<ASV> For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done nothing but evil in my eyes from their earliest years: the children of Israel have only made me angry with the work of their hands, says the Lord.

<ASV> Now at the time of the grain-cutting, Reuben saw some love-fruits in the field, and took them to his mother Leah. And Rachel said to her, Let me have some of your son's love-fruits.
<ASV> But for the rest, take from among the people able men, such as have the fear of God, true men hating profits wrongly made; and put such men over them, to be captains of thousands, captains of hundreds and of fifties and of tens;
<ASV> Who do wrong to the poor in their cause, and take away the right of the crushed among my people, so that they may have the property of widows, and get under their power those who have no father.
<ASV> The sea has come up over Babylon; she is covered with the mass of its waves.

<ASV> For they go against you with evil designs, and your haters make sport of your name.
<ASV> After two days is the Passover, and the Son of man will be given up to the death of the cross.
<ASV> The hangings for the open space, its pillars and their bases, and the curtain for the doorway;
<ASV> And put away foolish and uncontrolled questionings, seeing that they are a cause of trouble.
<ASV> The kingdom of heaven is like a secret store of wealth in a field, which a man came across and put back again; and in his joy he goes and gives all he has, to get that field.

<ASV> Son of man, say as a prophet, These are the words of the Lord: Say, A sword, a sword which has been made sharp and polished:

<ASV> Gibeon and Ramah and Beeroth

<ASV> But Esau said, I have enough; keep what is yours, my brother, for yourself.
<ASV> And these men said to him, We have been made unclean by the dead body of a man; why may we not make the offering of the Lord at the regular time among the children of Israel?
<ASV> So they and their sons had the care of the doors of the house of the Lord, the house of the Tent, as watchers.
<ASV> And a separate tenth part of the best meal mixed with oil for a meal offering for every lamb; for a burned offering of a sweet smell, an offering made by fire to the Lord.
<ASV> Now he who has made us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a witness of what is to come.
<ASV> To take you out of the power of the strange woman, who says smooth words with her tongue;
<ASV> Up, now! for this is your business, and we are with you; take heart and do it.

<ASV> If it is in the threads of the linen or of the wool, or in leather, or in anything made of skin;
<ASV> For people will come in my name, saying, I am the Christ; and a number will be turned from the true way through them.
<ASV> If you will not take care to do all the words of this law, recorded in this book, honouring that name of glory and of fear, THE LORD YOUR GOD;
<ASV> And say to them, This you are to do: take carts from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and get your father and come back.
<ASV> The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be praise for ever, is witness that the things which I say are true.
<ASV> In those days, Judah will have salvation and Jerusalem will be safe: and this is the name which will be given to her: The Lord is our righteousness.
<ASV> They even made offerings of their sons and their daughters to evil spirits,
<ASV> He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, copying the disgusting ways of the nations whom the Lord had sent out of the land before the children of Israel.
<ASV> And he sent down manna like rain for their food, and gave them the grain of heaven.
<ASV> And they will say, This land which was waste has become like the garden of Eden; and the towns which were unpeopled and wasted and pulled down are walled and peopled.
<ASV> And he was purposing to put an end to them if Moses, his special servant, had not gone up before him, between him and his people, turning back his wrath, to keep them from destruction.
<ASV> And God-fearing men put Stephen's body in its last resting-place, making great weeping over him.
<ASV> For the Lord had made the sound of carriages and horses, and the noise of a great army, come to the ears of the Aramaeans, so that they said to one another, Truly, the king of Israel has got the kings of the Hittites and of the Egyptians for a price to make an attack on us.
<ASV> Give us help in our trouble; for there is no help in man.
<ASV> And the dead body of Jezebel will be like waste dropped on the face of the earth in the heritage of Jezreel; so that they will not be able to say, This is Jezebel.
<ASV> Be preaching the word at all times, in every place; make protests, say sharp words, give comfort, with long waiting and teaching;
<ASV> Then the house of Zabdi came forward man by man, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
<ASV> For our salvation is by hope: but hope which is seen is not hope: for who is hoping for what he sees?
<ASV> And they went on from the mountains of Abarim, and put up their tents in the lowlands of Moab by Jordan at Jericho;
<ASV> What may we say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us?
<ASV> For this reason, because we have been made servants of this new order, through the mercy given to us, we are strong:
<ASV> And they took with them seven oxen and seven male sheep and seven lambs and seven he-goats as a sin-offering for the kingdom and for the holy house and for Judah. And he gave orders to the sons of Aaron, the priests, that these were to be offered on the altar of the Lord.
<ASV> See, I am crushing you down, as one is crushed under a cart full of grain.
<ASV> And he said to me, Son of man, do you see what they are doing? even the very disgusting things which the children of Israel are doing here, causing me to go far away from my holy place? but you will see other most disgusting things.
<ASV> For I did not get it from man, and I was not given teaching in it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.

<ASV> On that day, if anyone is on the roof of the house, and his goods are in the house, let him not go down to take them away; and let him who is in the field not go back to his house.
<ASV> And of the sons of Azgad, Johanan, the son of Hakkatan; and with him a hundred and ten males.
<ASV> And she took the cooking-pot, and put the cakes before him, but he would not take them. And Amnon said, Let everyone go away from me. So they all went out.
<ASV> The curse of the Lord is on the house of the evil-doer, but his blessing is on the tent of the upright.
<ASV> And the Lord said, Because they have given up my law which I put before them, giving no attention to my voice and not being guided by it;
<ASV> Give attention to yourselves, and to all the flock which the Holy Spirit has given into your care, to give food to the church of God, for which he gave his blood.
<ASV> My son, give attention to my words; let your ear be turned to my sayings.
<ASV> In earlier times the name of Hebron had been Kiriath-arba, named after Arba, the greatest of the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.
<ASV> And this is the way you are to make it: it is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high.
<ASV> And the angel who was talking to me came again, awaking me as a man out of his sleep.
<ASV> Now David was seated between the two town doors; and the watchman went up to the roof of the doorways, on the wall, and, lifting up his eyes, saw a man running by himself.
<ASV> And have knowledge of his desires, and are a judge of the things which are different, having the learning of the law,
<ASV> Now I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision to give effect to the undertakings given by God to the fathers,
<ASV> Pharaoh will see them and be comforted on account of all his people: even Pharaoh and all his army, put to death by the sword, says the Lord.
<ASV> Because Abraham gave ear to my voice and kept my words, my rules, my orders, and my laws.
<ASV> And for the drink offering, you are to give with the burned offering or other offering, the fourth part of a hin of wine for every lamb.
<ASV> Keep in mind, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat and what they did, and Noadiah, the woman prophet, and the rest of the prophets whose purpose was to put fear into me.
<ASV> Let his children be wanderers, looking to others for their food; let them be sent away from the company of their friends.
<ASV> Yes, we ourselves have had the answer of death in ourselves, so that our hope might not be in ourselves, but in God who is able to give life to the dead:
<ASV> But he sent representatives to him, saying, What have I to do with you, O king of Judah? I have not come against you this day, but against those with whom I am at war; and God has given me orders to go forward quickly: keep out of God's way, for he is with me, or he will send destruction on you.
<ASV> And Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, went out from Mizpah with the purpose of meeting them, weeping on his way: and it came about that when he was face to face with them he said, Come to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam.
<ASV> My mouth will make clear your righteousness and your salvation all the day; for they are more than may be measured.
<ASV> He makes a resting-place for me in the green fields: he is my guide by the quiet waters.
<ASV> Or may one go on lighted coals, and his feet not be burned?
<ASV> For this reason, Zion will be ploughed like a field because of you, and Jerusalem will become a mass of broken walls, and the mountain of the house like a high place in the woods.
<ASV> And on the east, your limit will be marked out from Hazar-enan to Shepham,
<ASV> Then they came to Zerubbabel and to the heads of families, and said to them, Let us take part in the building with you; for we are servants of your God, even as you are; and we have been making offerings to him from the days of Esar-haddon, king of Assyria, who put us here.
<ASV> There went up a smoke from his nose, and a fire of destruction from his mouth: coals were lighted by it.
<ASV> How feeble is your heart, says the Lord, seeing that you do all these things, the work of a loose and overruling woman;
<ASV> For a sign that the Lord is upright; he is my Rock, there is no deceit in him.
<ASV> But if we have hope for that which we see not, then we will be able to go on waiting for it.
<ASV> So Joab had a horn sounded, and all the people came to a stop, and gave up going after Israel and fighting them.
<ASV> When you take an oath before God, put it quickly into effect, because he has no pleasure in the foolish; keep the oath you have taken.
<ASV> And I was dead, and see, I am living for ever, and I have the keys of death and of Hell.
<ASV> And Jesus did such a number of other things that, if every one was recorded, it is my opinion that even the world itself is not great enough for the books there would be.

<ASV> And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah.
<ASV> Now by the side of the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother's sister Mary, the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene.
<ASV> And the Lord said to Moses, Go on before the people, and take some of the chiefs of Israel with you, and take in your hand the rod which was stretched out over the Nile, and go.
<ASV> I am certain that whatever God does will be for ever. No addition may be made to it, nothing may be taken from it; and God has done it so that man may be in fear before him.
<ASV> And it is my decision that any people, nation, or language saying evil against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, will be cut to bits and their houses made waste: because there is no other god who is able to give salvation such as this.
<ASV> The land is given into the power of the evil-doer; the faces of its judges are covered; if not by him, then who has done it?
<ASV> And he took the measure of the covered way of the doorway inside,
<ASV> And to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,
<ASV> And she took it up and went into the town; and she let her mother-in-law see what she had got, and after taking enough for herself she gave her the rest.
<ASV> Now this he said, pointing out the sort of death by which he would give God glory. And after saying this, he said to him, Come after me.
<ASV> An evil and false generation is searching after a sign; and no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah. And he went away from them.
<ASV> Put your works into the hands of the Lord, and your purposes will be made certain.
<ASV> The wise men are shamed, they are overcome with fear and taken: see, they have given up the word of the Lord; and what use is their wisdom to them?
<ASV> And the Lord said, Take off the shoes from your feet, for the place where you are is holy.
<ASV> Judah has been acting falsely, and a disgusting thing has been done in Jerusalem; for Judah has made unclean the holy place of the Lord which is dear to him, and has taken as his wife the daughter of a strange god.
<ASV> You are burning with desire, and have not your desire, so you put men to death; you are full of envy, and you are not able to get your desire, so you are fighting and making war; you have not your desire, because you do not make request for it.
<ASV> He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as Manasseh his father had done; and Amon made offerings to all the images which his father Manasseh had made, and was their servant.
<ASV> But when this has taken place, then that which was said in the Writings will come true, Death is overcome by life.
<ASV> And news of it went all through Joppa, and a number of people had faith in the Lord.
<ASV> Of the sons of Nebo, Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Iddo, and Joel, Benaiah.
<ASV> And I will have a fire lighted on the wall of Damascus, burning up the great houses of Ben-hadad.
<ASV> But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who had not on a guest's robe;
<ASV> And it was in my mind to give you the chance of taking it, with the approval of those seated here and of the responsible men of my people. If you are ready to do what it is right for a relation to do, then do it: but if you will not do it, say so to me now; for there is no one who has the right to do it but you, and after you myself. And he said, I will do it.
<ASV> Then Pharaoh said, In my dream I was by the side of the Nile:
<ASV> Your hand is lifted up against those who are against you, and all your haters will be cut off.
<ASV> But Jehu did not take care to keep the law of the Lord with all his heart: he did not keep himself from the sin which Jeroboam did and made Israel do.
<ASV> So, then, as to the question of taking food offered to images, we are certain that an image is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.
<ASV> At the voice of the Lord there is a shaking in the waste land, even a shaking in the waste land of Kadesh.
<ASV> And he said, What would you have? And she said, Your ring and its cord and the stick in your hand. So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she became with child by him.
<ASV> He has given you a false account of me: but my lord the king is like the angel of God: do then whatever seems good to you.
<ASV> And I saw a strong angel saying in a loud voice, Who is able to make the book open, and to undo its stamps?
<ASV> My eyes have seen trouble come on my haters; my ears have news of the fate of the evil-doers who have come up against me.
<ASV> I am certain that the Lord will take care of the cause of the poor, and of the rights of those who are troubled.
<ASV> And having put him on one side, he made David their king, to whom he gave witness, saying, I have taken David, the son of Jesse, a man dear to my heart, who will do all my pleasure.

<ASV> My flesh was made by you, and my parts joined together in my mother's body.
<ASV> Then said I, Ah, Lord God! your words were not true when you said to this people and to Jerusalem, You will have peace; when the sword has come even to the soul.
<ASV> And he went on living after the birth of Enosh for eight hundred and seven years, and had sons and daughters:

<ASV> Two women will be crushing grain together; one will be taken away and the other let go.
<ASV> And they will see that I am the Lord their God, who took them out of the land of Egypt, so that I might be ever with them: I am the Lord their God.
<ASV> Come, my loved one, let us go out into the field; let us take rest among the cypress-trees.
<ASV> Now while they were living in that country, Reuben had connection with Bilhah, his father's servant-woman: and Israel had news of it.
<ASV> You may be certain that nothing which the Lord has said about the family of Ahab will be without effect; for the Lord has done what he said by his servant Elijah.
<ASV> And so I will give him punishment and let him go.
<ASV> My mouth was open wide, waiting with great desire for your teachings.
<ASV> Then Jacob took young branches of trees, cutting off the skin so that the white wood was seen in bands.
<ASV> I gave orders to Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus make any profit out of you? were we not guided by the same Spirit, in the same ways?
<ASV> And he said to Sarah, See, I have given to your brother a thousand bits of silver so that your wrong may be put right; now your honour is clear in the eyes of all.
<ASV> Give ear to the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom; let your hearts be turned to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.
<ASV> For if you have love for those who have love for you, what credit is it to you? do not the tax-farmers the same?
<ASV> For all our days have gone by in your wrath; our years come to an end like a breath.
<ASV> Do not be false to the married relation.
<ASV> Now the Apostles and the brothers who were in Judaea had news that the word of God had been given to the Gentiles.
<ASV> And in the same way the Spirit is a help to our feeble hearts: for we are not able to make prayer to God in the right way; but the Spirit puts our desires into words which are not in our power to say;
<ASV> I will give my answer; I will put forward my knowledge:
<ASV> Yes, I will have you walked on by the feet of men, even my people Israel; they will have you for a heritage and you will be theirs, and never again will you take their children from them.
<ASV> The Kenite, the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,
<ASV> These are the families of Naphtali by their families: and those who were numbered of them were forty-five thousand, four hundred.
<ASV> So now, may my prayer come before you, and let the power of the Lord be great, as you said:
<ASV> For if the war-horn gives out an uncertain note, who will get ready for the fight?
<ASV> Or while the other is still a great distance away, he sends representatives requesting conditions of peace.
<ASV> Happy is the man whose strength is in you; in whose heart are the highways to Zion.
<ASV> And do not give way to the Evil One.
<ASV> And Zebadiah and Arad and Eder
<ASV> Because, as numbers of men became sinners through the wrongdoing of one man, even so will great numbers get righteousness through the keeping of the word of God by one man.
<ASV> If we have been planting the things of the Spirit for you, does it seem a great thing for you to give us a part in your things of this world?
<ASV> Before your holy eyes sin may not be seen, and you are unable to put up with wrong; why, then, are your eyes on the false? why do you say nothing when the evil-doer puts an end to one who is more upright than himself?
<ASV> You may not have sex connection with anyone who is a near relation: I am the Lord.
<ASV> And Isaac said to them, Why have you come to me, seeing that in your hate for me you sent me away from you?
<ASV> And after the birth of Shelah, Arpachshad went on living for four hundred and three years, and had sons and daughters:
<ASV> Israel has done wrong, sinning against the agreement which I made with them: they have even taken of the cursed thing; acting falsely like thieves they have put it among their goods.
<ASV> Give praise to the Lord, all you his armies; and you his servants who do his pleasure.
<ASV> Their altars and their pillars are to be broken down, and their holy trees burned with fire, and the images of their gods cut down; you are to take away their names out of that place.
<ASV> So then, let us not take our rest as the others do, but let us be self-controlled and awake.
<ASV> Against her the bow of the archer is bent, and he puts on his coat of metal: have no mercy on her young men, give all her army up to the curse.
<ASV> And Ophir and Havilah and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.
<ASV> Truly, if you are crying out for good sense, and your request is for knowledge;
<ASV> Do not do your ploughing with an ox and an ass yoked together.
<ASV> But I say, Go on in the Spirit, and you will not come under the rule of the evil desires of the flesh.
<ASV> Let the waste land and its flocks be glad, the tent-circles of Kedar; let the people of the rock give a glad cry, from the top of the mountains let them make a sound of joy.

<ASV> And they gave teaching in Judah and had the book of the law of the Lord with them; they went through all the towns of Judah teaching the people.

<ASV> And when they came to Nacon's grain-floor, Uzzah put his hand on the ark of God to keep it safe in its place, for the oxen were out of control.

<ASV> And the servant who was in authority over the cutters said, It is a Moabite girl who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab;
<ASV> And Janim, and Beth-tappuah, and Aphekah;
<ASV> Now these are their living-places, the limits inside which they were to put up their tents: to the sons of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites, because they had the first selection,
<ASV> And the sons of Pallu, Eliab
<ASV> On that day there was a reading from the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and they saw that it said in the book that no Ammonite or Moabite might ever come into the meeting of God;
<ASV> And Lot went out to them in the doorway, shutting the door after him.
<ASV> I will put an end to them completely, says the Lord: there are no grapes on the vine and no figs on the fig-tree, and the leaf is dry.
<ASV> The brass which was given was seventy talents, two thousand four hundred shekels;
<ASV> For I have been troubled all the day; every morning have I undergone punishment.
<ASV> For you see what care was produced in you by this very sorrow of yours before God, what clearing of yourselves, what wrath against sin, what fear, what desire, what serious purpose, what punishment. In everything you have made it clear that you are free from sin in this business.
<ASV> And what other nation in the earth, like your people Israel, did a god go out to take for himself, to be his people, making his name great and to be feared, driving out the nations from before your people whom you made free and took out of Egypt?

<ASV> But she said, Yes, Lord: but even the dogs take the bits from under their masters' table.
<ASV> If, in the land which the Lord your God is giving you, you come across the dead body of a man in the open country, and you have no idea who has put him to death:
<ASV> And the children of Ammon and Moab made an attack on the people of Mount Seir with a view to their complete destruction; and when they had put an end to the people of Seir, everyman's hand was turned against his neighbour for his destruction.
<ASV> And the Spirit gave me orders to go with them, doubting nothing. And these six brothers came with me; and we went into that man's house:
<ASV> If there is an argument between men and they go to law with one another, let the judges give their decision for the upright, and against the wrongdoer.
<ASV> Then Ezra got up, and made the chiefs of the priests and the Levites and all Israel take an oath that they would do this. So they took an oath.
<ASV> And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel, the son of Ammihud.
<ASV> But if we are dead with Christ, we have faith that we will be living with him;
<ASV> And Noah went on living three hundred and fifty years after the great flow of waters;
<ASV> Let him make his request in faith, doubting nothing; for he who has doubt in his heart is like the waves of the sea, which are troubled by the driving of the wind.
<ASV> For this reason, I will again put forward my cause against you, says the Lord, even against you and against your children's children.
<ASV> Now when it came to the ears of Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, that Joshua had taken Ai, and had given it up to the curse (for as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he had done to Ai and its king); and that the people of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were living among them;
<ASV> And after they had gone through the land of Phrygia and Galatia, the Holy Spirit did not let them take the word into Asia;
<ASV> For their downfall will come suddenly; and who has knowledge of the destruction of those in high positions?
<ASV> The man who says, I have knowledge of him, and does not keep his laws, is false, and there is nothing true in him:
<ASV> But if you are guided by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
<ASV> And the Evil One came and said to him, If you are the Son of God, give the word for these stones to become bread.
<ASV> For myself, even because of my name, I will do it; for I will not let my name be shamed; and my glory I will not give to another.
<ASV> Now the beasts taken, in addition to what the fighting-men took for themselves, were six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep,

<ASV> And Zechariah and Aziel and Shemiramoth and Jehiel, Unni and Eliab and Maaseiah and Benaiah, with corded instruments put to Alamoth.
<ASV> The flesh of the men of war will be your food, and your drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of sheep and lambs, of he-goats, of oxen, all of them fat beasts of Bashan.
<ASV> For this cause all hands will be feeble, and every heart of man be turned to water;
<ASV> He who goes after righteousness and mercy will get life, righteousness, and honour.
<ASV> He who is not with me is against me, and he who will not give me help in getting people together is driving them away.
<ASV> If I saw one near to death for need of clothing, and that the poor had nothing covering him;
<ASV> And Jacob said, The years of my wanderings have been a hundred and thirty; small in number and full of sorrow have been the years of my life, and less than the years of the wanderings of my fathers.
<ASV> And what will you do in the day of punishment, and in the destruction which is coming from far? to whom will you go for help, and what will become of your glory?

<ASV> Who, in his time, made clear his word in the good news, of which, by the order of God our Saviour, I became a preacher;
<ASV> And a woman, who had had a flow of blood for twelve years, and had given all her money to medical men, and not one of them was able to make her well,
<ASV> Then do not go after false gods, as some of them did; as it is said in the holy Writings, After resting and feasting, the people got up to take their pleasure.
<ASV> And Joseph sent food to them from his table, but he sent five times as much to Benjamin as to any of the others. And they took wine freely with him.
<ASV> In the thought of him who is in comfort there is no respect for one who is in trouble; such is the fate of those whose feet are slipping.
<ASV> And if any of the flesh of the offering or of the bread is over till the morning, let it be burned with fire; it is not to be used for food, for it is holy.
<ASV> Then the heads of families and the chiefs of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the controllers of the king's business, freely gave themselves;
<ASV> To the clean in heart all things are clean: but to those who are unclean and without faith nothing is clean; they become unclean in mind and in thought.
<ASV> And you are to take them before the Lord, and the priests will put salt on them, offering them up for a burned offering to the Lord.
<ASV> And he kept his eyes fixed on him till he was shamed, and the man of God was overcome with weeping.
<ASV> And some of those who were supporters of the theories of the Epicureans and the Stoics, had a meeting with him. And some said, What is this talker of foolish words saying? And others, He seems to be a preacher of strange gods: because he was preaching of Jesus and his coming back from the dead.
<ASV> And the beast which was, and is not, is himself the eighth, and is of the seven; and he goes into destruction.
<ASV> Keep in mind what Moses, the servant of the Lord, said to you, The Lord your God is sending you rest and will give you this land.
<ASV> Ruling over Judah in Hebron for seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem, over all Israel and Judah, for thirty-three years.

<ASV> And unleavened bread, and unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and thin unleavened cakes on which oil has been put, made of the best bread-meal;

<ASV> Then fire came out from the Lord, burning up the two hundred and fifty men who were offering the perfume.
<ASV> But let your hand be open to give him the use of whatever he is in need of.

<ASV> And the words of the Lord came into my mind, how he said, The baptism of John was with water, but you will have baptism with the Holy Spirit.
<ASV> For, if by their putting away, the rest of men have been made friends with God, what will their coming back again be, but life from the dead?
<ASV> Now when he came near to Egypt, he said to Sarai, his wife, Truly, you are a fair woman and beautiful to the eye;
<ASV> Then Haggai, whom the Lord had sent to give his words to the people, said, I am with you, says the Lord.
<ASV> And these are the generations of Esau, the father of the Edomites in the hill-country of Seir:

<ASV> Let the Lord keep in mind the wrongdoing of his fathers; and may the sin of his mother have no forgiveness.

<ASV> Then take some of the blood and put it on the two sides of the door and over the door of the house where the meal is to be taken.
<ASV> Give what property you have in exchange for money, and give the money to the poor; make for yourselves money-bags which will not get old, wealth stored up in heaven which will be yours for ever, where thieves will not come nor worms put it to destruction.
<ASV> For you are to be worshippers of no other god: for the Lord is a God who will not give his honour to another.
<ASV> And I have knowledge that his order is eternal life: so that the things which I say, I say them even as the Father says them to me.
<ASV> And put on the new man, to which God has given life, in righteousness and a true and holy way of living.
<ASV> Whom then is God like, in your opinion? or what will you put forward as a comparison with him?
<ASV> So why have you made no protest against Jeremiah of Anathoth, who is acting as a prophet to you?
<ASV> And he said to me, Son of man, have you seen what the responsible men of the children of Israel do in the dark, every man in his room of pictured images? for they say, The Lord does not see us; the Lord has gone away from the land.
<ASV> And he said, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then the Lord said to me, The end has come to my people Israel; never again will my eyes be shut to their sin.
<ASV> And if a man has sex relations with a beast, let him be put to death, and let the beast be put to destruction.

<ASV> Truly, God is great, greater than all our knowledge; the number of his years may not be searched out.
<ASV> And let your name be made great for ever, and let men say, The Lord of armies is God over Israel: and let the family of David your servant be made strong before you!
<ASV> In that day I will make a horn put out buds for the children of Israel, and I will let your words come freely among them, and they will be certain that I am the Lord.
<ASV> Then, after forty days, through the open window of the ark which he had made,
<ASV> He has made clear to you, O man, what is good; and what is desired from you by the Lord; only doing what is right, and loving mercy, and walking without pride before your God.
<ASV> And Johanan was the father of Azariah, (he was priest in the house which Solomon put up in Jerusalem:)
<ASV> For your Maker is your husband; the Lord of armies is his name: and the Holy One of Israel is he who takes up your cause; he will be named the God of all the earth.
<ASV> And you and your sons with you are to be responsible as priests for the altar and everything on it, and everything inside the veil; you are to do the work of priests; I have given you your position as priests; and any other man who comes near will be put to death.
<ASV> And he gave them teaching in the form of a story, saying, A man went out to put seed in the earth;
<ASV> To the rest of the Levites, the sons of Merari, were given, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Rimmono with its outskirts, Tabor with its outskirts;
<ASV> They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another while they were in the Temple, What is your opinion? Will he not come to the feast?
<ASV> And in the morning he went out and, stopping, said to all the people there, You are upright men: it is true that I made designs against my master, and put him to death; but who is responsible for the death of all these?
<ASV> Who has made open the doors of his face? Fear is round about his teeth.
<ASV> But he came through them and went on his way.
<ASV> Why do you keep far away, O Lord? why are you not to be seen in times of trouble?
<ASV> And the sound of the wings of the winged ones was clear even in the outer square, like the voice of the Ruler of all.
<ASV> And a very great number went to their death, because the war was God's purpose. And they went on living in their place till they were taken away as prisoners.
<ASV> &lt;SAMECH&gt; I am a hater of men of doubting mind; but I am a lover of your law.
<ASV> And the sons of Cush: Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
<ASV> For this reason, when I was no longer able to keep quiet, I sent to get news of your faith, fearing that you might be tested by the Evil One and that our work might come to nothing.
<ASV> Then the Lord said to Joshua,
<ASV> And said, The Lord has let us see his glory and his power, and his voice has come to us out of the fire: today we have seen that a man may go on living even after hearing the voice of God.
<ASV> (I was between the Lord and you at that time, to make clear to you the word of the Lord: because, through fear of the fire, you did not go up the mountain;) saying,
<ASV> Then Abner had a talk with the chief men of Israel, saying, In the past it was your desire to make David your king: so now, do it:
<ASV> Now while he was talking to me, I went into a deep sleep with my face to the earth: but touching me, he put me on my feet where I had been.
<ASV> At that time the Lord said to Moses, The day of your death is near: send for Joshua, and come to the Tent of meeting so that I may give him his orders. So Moses and Joshua went to the Tent of meeting.
<ASV> The Lord has done that which was his purpose; he has put into force the orders which he gave in the days which are past; pulling down without pity, he has made your hater glad over you, lifting up the horn of those who were against you.
<ASV> At the word of the Lord they put up their tents, and at the word of the Lord they went forward on their journey: they kept the orders of the Lord as he gave them by Moses.
<ASV> So let Bezalel and Oholiab get to work, with every wise-hearted man to whom the Lord has given wisdom and knowledge, to do whatever is necessary for the ordering of the holy place, as the Lord has given orders.

<ASV> But if he is taken in the act he will have to give back seven times as much, giving up all his property which is in his house.

<ASV> Jesus, answering them, said, Truly I say to you, You come after me, not because you saw signs, but because you were given the bread and had enough.
<ASV> At that time, Joshua went on to take Hazor and put its king to the sword: for in earlier times Hazor was the chief of all those kingdoms.
<ASV> Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all the rest of the people, gave ear to the voice of the Lord their God and to the words of Haggai the prophet, because the Lord their God had sent him, and the people were in fear before the Lord.
<ASV> Again, he sent other servants more in number than the first: and they did the same to them.

<ASV> Who say to a tree, You are my father; and to a stone, You have given me life: for their backs have been turned to me, not their faces: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Up! and be our saviour.
<ASV> He who takes my flesh for food and my blood for drink has eternal life: and I will take him up from the dead at the last day.

<ASV> The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.

<ASV> Then some of the Pharisees said, That man has not come from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath. Others said, How is it possible for a sinner to do such signs? So there was a division among them.

<ASV> Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and his servants and his princes and all his people;
<ASV> Now Naaman, chief of the army of the king of Aram, was a man of high position with his master, and greatly respected, because by him the Lord had given salvation to Aram; but he was a leper.

<ASV> &lt;To the chief music-maker; put to At-tashheth. Michtam. Of David. When Saul sent, and they were watching the house, to put him to death.&gt; Take me out of the hands of the cruel ones, O my God; keep me safe from those who come up against me.

<ASV> And though your start was small, your end will be very great.
<ASV> Then Isaac sent for Jacob, and blessing him, said, Do not take a wife from among the women of Canaan;
<ASV> At his death, Jobab, son of Zerah of Bozrah, became king in his place.
<ASV> And he put to death the ox and the sheep, which were the peace-offerings for the people; and Aaron's sons gave him the blood and he put some of it on and round the altar;

<ASV> For this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: As my wrath and passion have been let loose on the people of Jerusalem, so will my passion be let loose on you when you go into Egypt: and you will become an oath and a cause of wonder and a curse and a name of shame; and you will never see this place again.
<ASV> For I have not said it on my authority, but the Father who sent me gave me orders what to say and how to say it.
<ASV> The Lord is slow to wrath and great in mercy, overlooking wrongdoing and evil, and will not let wrongdoers go free; sending punishment on children for the sins of their fathers, to the third and fourth generation.
<ASV> Those who have no fear of God keep wrath stored up in their hearts; they give no cry for help when they are made prisoners.

<ASV> Joseph is a young ox, whose steps are turned to the fountain;
<ASV> I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead but of the living.
<ASV> Because they had no faith in God, and no hope in his salvation.
<ASV> But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot (who was to give him up), said,
<ASV> Happy is he whose resting-place is in the secret of the Lord, and under the shade of the wings of the Most High;
<ASV> He gives the unfertile woman a family, making her a happy mother of children. Give praise to the Lord.
<ASV> Do not be friends with a man who is given to wrath; do not go in the company of an angry man:
<ASV> A beka, that is, half a shekel by the holy scale, for everyone who was numbered; there were six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty men of twenty years old and over.
<ASV> And there in the Temple he saw men trading in oxen and sheep and doves, and he saw the changers of money in their seats:
<ASV> But he went against his authority in sending representatives to Egypt to get from them horses and a great army. Will he do well? will he be safe who does such things? if the agreement is broken will he be safe?
<ASV> So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went with him: and all the people of Judah, as well as half the people of Israel, took the king on his way.
<ASV> If a man has the fear of the Lord, the Lord will be his teacher in the way of his pleasure.
<ASV> Come now, you men of wealth, give yourselves to weeping and crying because of the bitter troubles which are coming to you.
<ASV> Rooting them out of their land, in the heat of his wrath and passion, and driving them out into another land, as at this day.
<ASV> For God makes low those whose hearts are lifted up, but he is a saviour to the poor in spirit.
<ASV> And you came back, weeping before the Lord; but the Lord gave no attention to your cries and did not give ear to you.
<ASV> And in great fear Isaac said, Who then is he who got meat and put it before me, and I took it all before you came, and gave him a blessing, and his it will be?
<ASV> So that the land may not put you out from it, when you make it unclean, as it put out the nations which were there before you.

<ASV> And he said, Take care that you are not tricked: for a number of people will come in my name, saying, I am he; and, The time is near: do not go after them.
<ASV> And the bowman will not keep his place; he who is quick-footed will not get away safely: and the horseman will not keep his life.
<ASV> All those things which were used as offerings to take away sin, and to make them holy to be priests, they may have for food: but no one who is not a priest may have them, for they are holy food.
<ASV> The start of fighting is like the letting out of water: so give up before it comes to blows.
<ASV> Because you have been my help, I will have joy in the shade of your wings.
<ASV> Uncovering deep things out of the dark, and making the deep shade bright;
<ASV> I made my prayer to the Lord in my trouble: and the Lord gave me an answer, and put me in a wide place.
<ASV> And you are to give an offering made by fire, a burned offering to the Lord; two oxen, one male sheep, and seven he-lambs of the first year, without any mark:
<ASV> Then Isaiah said, Take a cake of figs. So they took it and put it on his wound, and he got better.
<ASV> Asher's bread is fat; he gives delicate food for kings.

<ASV> I have made you a tester among my people, so that you may have knowledge of their way and put it to the test.
<ASV> O Israel, have hope in the Lord, from this time and for ever.
<ASV> Make a song to the Lord; for he has done noble things: give news of them through all the earth.
<ASV> But see to it, when he goes to rest, that you take note of the place where he is sleeping, and go in there, and, uncovering his feet, take your place by him; and he will say what you are to do.
<ASV> Then she said, Here is my servant Bilhah, go in to her, so that she may have a child on my knees, and I may have a family by her.

<ASV> And the man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me the fruit of the tree and I took it.
<ASV> For I have been armed by you with strength for the fight: you have made low under me those who came out against me.
<ASV> Now in the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses gave to the children of Israel all the orders which the Lord had given him for them;
<ASV> The ploughmen were ploughing on my back; long were the wounds they made.
<ASV> And the father of Publius was ill, with a disease of the stomach; to whom Paul went, and put his hands on him, with prayer, and made him well.
<ASV> And your hand will have to let go your heritage which I gave you; and I will make you a servant to your haters in a land which is strange to you: for you have put my wrath on fire with a flame which will go on burning for ever.
<ASV> So to this day they go on in their old ways, not worshipping the Lord or keeping his orders or his ways or the law and the rule which the Lord gave to the children of Jacob, to whom he gave the name Israel;
<ASV> But if it is taken from him by a thief, he is to make up for the loss of it to its owner.
<ASV> And the Lord said to Moses,
<ASV> But gave them the answer put forward by the young men, saying, My father made your yoke hard, but I will make it harder; my father gave you punishment with whips, but I will give it with snakes.

<ASV> And for those who are in sorrow, to give no signs of it; and for those who are glad, to give no signs of joy; and for those who are getting property, to be as if they had nothing;
<ASV> And the land is shaking and in pain: for the purposes of the Lord are fixed, to make the land of Babylon an unpeopled waste.
<ASV> Shemaiah the Nehelamite sent a letter in his name to Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,
<ASV> These are the same Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said, Take the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt in their armies.
<ASV> It would be a fire burning even to destruction, and taking away all my produce.
<ASV> By day and night they go round the town, on the walls; trouble and sorrow are in the heart of it.
<ASV> When the Lord your God makes wide the limit of your land, as he has said, and you say, I will take flesh for my food, because you have a desire for it; then you may take whatever flesh you have a desire for.
<ASV> Or the position of a Deacon of the church, let a man give himself to it; or he who has the power of teaching, let him make use of it;
<ASV> But may your servant have the Lord's forgiveness for this one thing: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon for worship there, supported on my arm, and my head is bent in the house of Rimmon; when his head is bent in the house of Rimmon, may your servant have the Lord's forgiveness for this thing.
<ASV> And the men he had sent came back to the king; and he said to them, Why have you come back?

<ASV> Because in the waste land of Zin, when the people were angry, you and he went against my word and did not keep my name holy before their eyes, at the waters. (These are the waters of Meribah in Kadesh in the waste land of Zin.)
<ASV> That word you yourselves have knowledge of, which was made public through all Judaea, starting from Galilee, after the baptism of which John was the preacher,

<ASV> And he sent for him and said, What is this which is said about you? give me an account of all you have done, for you will no longer be the manager of my property.
<ASV> Truly God is lifted up in strength; who is a ruler like him?

<ASV> And say to the master of the house, The Master says, Where is the guest-room, where I may take the Passover with my disciples?

<ASV> And after the noise had come to an end, Paul, having sent for the disciples and given them comfort, went away from them to Macedonia.
<ASV> And that night they made their father take much wine; and the older daughter went into his bed; and he had no knowledge of when she went in or when she went away.
<ASV> Is not God as high as heaven? and see the stars, how high they are!
<ASV> The Lord has given up to destruction all the living-places of Jacob without pity; pulling down in his wrath the strong places of the daughter of Judah, stretching out on the earth the wounded, even her king and her rulers.
<ASV> And so that he may make you his people today, and be your God, as he has said to you, and as he made an oath to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

<ASV> Foolish behaviour is joy to the unwise; but a man of good sense makes his way straight.
<ASV> And I saw a white horse, and he who was seated on it had a bow; and there was given to him a crown: and he went out with power to overcome.
<ASV> Men whose ideas are all false, who say that the coming back from the dead has even now taken place, overturning the faith of some.
<ASV> (For Solomon had made a brass stage, five cubits long, five cubits wide and three cubits high, and had put it in the middle of the open space; on this he took his place and went down on his knees before all the meeting of Israel, stretching out his hands to heaven.)
<ASV> If anyone comes to you not having this teaching, do not take him into your house or give him words of love:
<ASV> And there he saw the daughter of a certain man of Canaan named Shua, and took her as his wife.
<ASV> Of the sons of Elizaphan: Shemaiah the chief, and his brothers, two hundred;
<ASV> And the priest who is making him clean will put the man who is being made clean, together with these things, before the door of the Tent of meeting.

<ASV> Let the things which are past come to your memory: for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is no one like me;
<ASV> Now this is the blessing which Moses, the man of God, gave to the children of Israel before his death.
<ASV> And are going to make an offering by fire to the Lord, a burned offering or an offering in connection with an oath, or an offering freely given, or at your regular feasts, an offering for a sweet smell to the Lord, from the herd or the flock:
<ASV> A voice of one saying, Give a cry! And I said, What is my cry to be? All flesh is grass, and all its strength like the flower of the field.
<ASV> Even when his wealth is great, he is full of care, for the hand of everyone who is in trouble is turned against him.

<ASV> Seeing that you are able to make certain of the fact that it is not more than twelve days from the time when I came up to Jerusalem for worship;

<ASV> The ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anathothite, of the Benjamites; and in his division were twenty-four thousand.

<ASV> Let him not put his hope in what is false, falling into error: for he will get deceit as his reward.
<ASV> For the baptism of John was with water, but you will have baptism with the Holy Spirit, after a little time.
<ASV> Who makes the word of his servants certain, and gives effect to the purposes of his representatives; who says of Jerusalem, Her people will come back to her; and of the towns of Judah, I will give orders for their building, and will make her waste places fertile again:

<ASV> And he who put them in the earth is Satan; and the getting in of the grain is the end of the world; and those who get it in are the angels.
<ASV> And Joshua said, By this you will see that the living God is among you, and that he will certainly send out from before you the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Hivite and the Perizzite and the Girgashite and the Amorite and the Jebusite.
<ASV> He will be the builder of my house, and I will make the seat of his authority certain for ever.
<ASV> May a man take fire to his breast without burning his clothing?
<ASV> All their evil-doing is in Gilgal; there I had hate for them; because of their evil-doing I will send them out of my house; they will no longer be dear to me; all their rulers are uncontrolled.
<ASV> And Moses gave orders to the children of Israel saying, This is the land which is to be your heritage, by the decision of the Lord, which by the Lord's order is to be given to the nine tribes and the half-tribe:
<ASV> That it may be burned by the priest on the altar; it is the food of the offering made by fire to the Lord.
<ASV> And he made the cover all of gold, two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.
<ASV> In this way, we are certain that we have love for the children of God, when we have love for God and keep his laws.
<ASV> And if a man gives to the Lord a field which he has got for money from another, which is not part of his heritage;
<ASV> Because he is a servant he has no interest in the sheep.
<ASV> And it is certain that if at any time you are turned away from the Lord your God, and go after other gods, to be their servants and to give them worship, destruction will overtake you.
<ASV> Truly, all those who make use of secret arts will be put to shame, and their words of power are only words of men: let them all come forward together; they will all be in fear and be put to shame.
<ASV> When I was in the Temple with you every day, your hands were not stretched out against me: but this is your hour, and the authority of the dark power.
<ASV> Madmenah has gone; the men of Gebim are putting their goods in a safe place.
<ASV> Their twenty pillars and their twenty bases were brass; and the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver.
<ASV> Who has put wisdom in the high clouds, or given knowledge to the lights of the north?
<ASV> In these towns you may be safe from him who has the right of punishment; so that death may not overtake the taker of life till he has been judged by the meeting of the people.
<ASV> But those who are full of fear and without faith, the unclean and takers of life, those who do the sins of the flesh, and those who make use of evil powers or who give worship to images, and all those who are false, will have their part in the sea of ever-burning fire which is the second death.
<ASV> But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, got money for his property,
<ASV> But the angel said, Have no fear, Zacharias, for your prayer has come to the ears of God, and your wife Elisabeth will have a son, and his name will be John.
<ASV> And like a band of thieves waiting for a man, so are the priests watching secretly the way of those going quickly to Shechem, for they are working with an evil design.
<ASV> And the king gave orders to Ashpenaz, the captain of his unsexed servants, to take in some of the children of Israel, certain of the king's family, and those of high birth;
<ASV> You will be cursed in the town and cursed in the field.
<ASV> Now in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch, king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goiim,
<ASV> Of the sons of Shecaniah; of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah; and with him were listed a hundred and fifty males.
<ASV> So Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad and the children of Reuben and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites and Og, king of Bashan, all the land with its towns and the country round them.
<ASV> And anyone touching one who has been put to death with the sword in the open country, or the body of one who has come to his end by a natural death, or a man's bone, or the resting-place of a dead body, will be unclean for seven days.
<ASV> Let not your eyes be turned on me, because I am dark, because I was looked on by the sun; my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vine-gardens; but my vine-garden I have not kept.
<ASV> And after discussion with the people, he put in their places those who were to make melody to the Lord, praising him in holy robes, while they went at the head of the army, and saying, May the Lord be praised, for his mercy is unchanging for ever.
<ASV> Who for a reward give support to the cause of the sinner, and who take away the righteousness of the upright from him.
<ASV> And great peoples and strong nations will come to give worship to the Lord of armies in Jerusalem and to make requests for grace from the Lord.
<ASV> And he is to take the two goats and put them before the Lord at the door of the Tent of meeting.
<ASV> The birds of the air and the fish of the sea, and whatever goes through the deep waters of the seas.
<ASV> And they went in to her, as men go to a loose woman: so they went in to Oholibah, the loose woman.

<ASV> And Pharaoh's great men, having seen her, said words in praise of her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into Pharaoh's house.
<ASV> By their side were working Melatiah the Gibeonite and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon and of Mizpah from the seat of the ruler across the river.
<ASV> As for the rest of the beasts, their authority was taken away: but they let them go on living for a measure of time.
<ASV> Then Elisha said, Give ear to the word of the Lord: the Lord says, Tomorrow, about this time, a measure of good meal will be offered for the price of a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the market-place of Samaria.
<ASV> Then the two men, between whom the argument has taken place, are to come before the Lord, before the priests and judges who are then in power;
<ASV> If I have gone in false ways, or my foot has been quick in working deceit;
<ASV> For he put his oath on one side in letting the agreement be broken; and though he had given his hand to it, he did all these things; he will not get away safe.
<ASV> A land cared for by the Lord your God: the eyes of the Lord your God are on it at all times from one end of the year to the other.
<ASV> For the ears of the Lord are open to the poor, and he takes thought for his prisoners.
<ASV> You are cut off from Christ, you who would have righteousness by the law; you are turned away from grace.
<ASV> And Moses said to them, Why have you kept all the women safe?
<ASV> All these had taken strange wives; and some of them had wives by whom they had offspring.
<ASV> And they went through Judah, getting together the Levites and the heads of families in Israel from all the towns of Judah, and they came to Jerusalem.
<ASV> And having different qualities by reason of the grace given to us, such as the quality of a prophet, let it be made use of in relation to the measure of our faith;
<ASV> Give my love to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers who are with them.
<ASV> The door-keepers: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of Hatita, the children of Shobai, a hundred and thirty-eight.
<ASV> And he said, Why, what evil has he done? But they gave loud cries, saying, To the cross with him!
<ASV> And the Avvim, living in the small towns as far as Gaza, came to destruction by the hands of the Caphtorim who came out from Caphtor and took their land.)
<ASV> To the sons of Gershom were given, out of the family of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Golan in Bashan with its outskirts, and Ashtaroth with its outskirts;
<ASV> And I will put over them one keeper, and he will give them food, even my servant David; he will give them food and be their keeper.
<ASV> When they were moving, they went on their four sides without turning; they went after the head in the direction in which it was looking; they went without turning.
<ASV> So the chiefs of Moab went back to Balak and said, Balaam will not come with us.
<ASV> By putting their doorstep by my doorstep, and the pillar of their door by the pillar of my door, with only a wall between me and them; and they have made my holy name unclean by the disgusting things which they have done: so in my wrath I sent destruction on them.
<ASV> And when he had a desire to go over into Achaia, the brothers gave him help, and sent letters to the disciples requesting them to take him in among them: and when he had come, he gave much help to those who had faith through grace:
<ASV> And they, if they do not go on without faith, will be united to the tree again, because God is able to put them in again.
<ASV> And Jesus went from there and came to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and took his seat there.
<ASV> And he took Elijah's robe, which had been dropped from him, and giving the water a blow with it, said, Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah? and at his blow the waters were parted this way and that; and Elisha went over.
<ASV> And Jesus, answering, said to them, Those who are well have no need of a medical man, but those who are ill.
<ASV> Because even those who undergo circumcision do not themselves keep the law; but they would have you undergo circumcision, so that they may have glory in your flesh.
<ASV> And Abraham said to Ephron, in the hearing of the people of the land, If only you will give ear to me, I will give you the price of the field; take it, and let me put my dead to rest there.
<ASV> He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for sixteen years.
<ASV> O Lord, righteousness is yours, but shame is on us, even to this day; and on the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem, and on all Israel, those who are near and those who are far off, in all the countries where you have sent them because of the sin which they have done against you.
<ASV> Give ear to this word, you cows of Bashan, who are in the hill of Samaria, by whom the poor are kept down, and those in need are crushed; who say to their lords, Get out the wine and give us drink.
<ASV> And he made a search, starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was in Benjamin's bag.
<ASV> I am yours, O be my saviour; for my desire has been for your rules.
<ASV> I made no sound, I said no word, even of good; and I was moved with sorrow.
<ASV> But he said, Woman, it is not true; I have no knowledge of him.
<ASV> From the goods taken in war, they gave, as a holy offering, materials for the building of the house of the Lord.
<ASV> He has forgiveness for all your sins; he takes away all your diseases;
<ASV> Jesus said these things in the Synagogue while he was teaching at Capernaum.
<ASV> And hearing it, they gave praise to God; and they said to him, You see, brother, what thousands there are among the Jews, who have the faith; and they all have a great respect for the law:
<ASV> So Israel was turned away from the family of David to this day.
<ASV> And a great voice in heaven came to my ears, saying, Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ: because he who says evil against our brothers before our God day and night is forced down.
<ASV> (That land is said to have been a land of the Rephaim, for Rephaim had been living there in earlier times, but they were named Zamzummim by the Ammonites;
<ASV> And all the land will become like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she will be lifted up and be living in her place; from the doorway of Benjamin to the place of the first doorway, to the doorway of the angle, and from the tower of Hananel to the king's wine-crushing places, men will be living in her.
<ASV> He who says that he is in the light, and has hate in his heart for his brother, is still in the dark.
<ASV> So Peter and the other disciple went out to the place of the dead.
<ASV> And the best of all the first-fruits of everything, and every offering which is lifted up of all your offerings, will be for the priests: and you are to give the priest the first of your bread-making, so causing a blessing to come on your house.
<ASV> Then you will say to your son, We were servants under Pharaoh's yoke in Egypt; and the Lord took us out of Egypt with a strong hand:
<ASV> And for this cause we still give praise to God, that, when the word came to your ears through us, you took it, not as the word of man, but, as it truly is, the word of God, which has living power in you who have faith.
<ASV> And they went and were living in the resting-place of Chimham, which is near Beth-lehem on the way into Egypt,
<ASV> And at the time when the flock were with young, I saw in a dream that all the he-goats which were joined with the she-goats were banded and marked and coloured.
<ASV> Then the Lord said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh and say to him, This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go so that they may give me worship.
<ASV> But if you are given to fighting with one another, take care that you are not the cause of destruction one to another.
<ASV> This is a true saying, A man desiring the position of a Bishop has a desire for a good work.
<ASV> Far over all rule and authority and power and every name which is named, not only in the present order, but in that which is to come:
<ASV> Let there be no turning to the right or to the left, keep your feet from evil.
<ASV> From Asher, Pagiel, the son of Ochran;
<ASV> Then Jesus was sent by the Spirit into the waste land to be tested by the Evil One.
<ASV> About Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, overcame. This is what the Lord has said: Up! go against Kedar, and make an attack on the children of the east.
<ASV> And the Lord will send out the sound of his great voice, and they will see his arm stretched out, with the heat of his wrath, and the flame of a burning fire; with a cloud-burst, and storm, and a rain of ice.
<ASV> So that there was the face of a man turned to the palm-tree on one side, and the face of a young lion on the other side: so it was made all round the house.
<ASV> Give high honour to the Lord our God, worshipping at his feet; holy is he.
<ASV> Then they had faith in his words; they gave him songs of praise.
<ASV> And all the workers in linen thread, and those who make cotton cloth, will be put to shame.
<ASV> It is through the Lord's love that we have not come to destruction, because his mercies have no limit.
<ASV> And they will take you in hand with hate, and take away all the fruit of your work, and let you be unveiled and without clothing: and the shame of your loose behaviour will be uncovered, your evil designs and your loose ways.
<ASV> It is better to be living in a waste land, than with a bitter-tongued and angry woman.
<ASV> And those of the sons of Merari who were numbered by families, in the order of their fathers' houses,
<ASV> But God said to me, You are not to be the builder of a house for my name, because you are a man of war and have taken life;
<ASV> And while they were talking and questioning together, Jesus himself came near and went with them.
<ASV> This is what the Lord of armies has said: If this is a wonder to the rest of this people, is it a wonder to me? says the Lord of armies.
<ASV> Then certain of the responsible men of Israel came to me and took their seats before me.
<ASV> But I have a fear, that in some way, as Eve was tricked by the deceit of the snake, your minds may be turned away from their simple and holy love for Christ.
<ASV> Now Jacob's fountain was there. Jesus, being tired after his journey, was resting by the fountain. It was about the sixth hour.
<ASV> But those whose desire is my soul's destruction will go down to the lower parts of the earth.
<ASV> And let them make no more offerings to evil spirits, after which they have gone, turning away from the Lord. Let this be a law to them for ever, through all their generations.
<ASV> And the man whose desire is for the wife of another is waiting for the evening, saying, No eye will see me; and he puts a cover on his face. And in the night the thief goes about;
<ASV> And if anyone's name was not in the book of life, he went down into the sea of fire.
<ASV> And will not give to any of them the flesh of his children which will be his food because he has no other; in the cruel grip of your haters on all your towns.
<ASV> Who may say that God will not be turned, changing his purpose and turning away from his burning wrath, so that destruction may not overtake us?
<ASV> You have given me the breastplate of your salvation: your right hand has been my support, and your mercy has made me great.
<ASV> But they gave no attention and would not give ear, but they made their necks stiff so that they might not give ear and might not get teaching.
<ASV> Then the angel of the Lord gave orders to Gad to say to David that he was to go and put up an altar to the Lord on the grain-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
<ASV> After this Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, became friends with Ahaziah, king of Israel, who did much evil:
<ASV> And when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the keepers of the sheep said to one another, Let us go now to Beth-lehem, and see this thing which has come about, which the Lord has made clear to us.
<ASV> To be put on the list with Mary, his future wife, who was about to become a mother.
<ASV> So, then, we are ever without fear, and though conscious that while we are in the body we are away from the Lord,
<ASV> That place was named the valley of Eshcol because of the grapes which the children of Israel took from there.
<ASV> Make the hearts of this people fat, and let their ears be stopped, and their eyes shut; for fear that they may see with their eyes, and be hearing with their ears, and their heart may become wise, and they may be turned to me and made well.
<ASV> See, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so the soul of the son is mine: death will be the fate of the sinner's soul.
<ASV> And when you have taken food and are full, and have made fair houses for yourselves and are living in them;
<ASV> Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in the great waters;
<ASV> The men of Beth-el and Ai, two hundred and twenty-three.
<ASV> The sons of Reuben, the oldest son of Israel: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi.
<ASV> Then Amaziah took heart, and went out at the head of his people and came to the Valley of Salt, where he put to death ten thousand of the children of Seir;
<ASV> And when he has got it again, he takes it in his arms with joy.
<ASV> When the upright man, turning away from his righteousness, does evil, death will overtake him; in the evil which he has done death will overtake him.
<ASV> Who has full knowledge of his errors? make me clean from secret evil.
<ASV> And Ummah and Aphek and Rehob; twenty-two towns with their unwalled places.
<ASV> And he said, Now give ear to my words: if there is a prophet among you I will give him knowledge of myself in a vision and will let my words come to him in a dream.
<ASV> And after eight days, his disciples were again in the house and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were shut, Jesus came, and taking his place in the middle of them, he said, May peace be with you!
<ASV> With your hand, O Lord, from men, even men of the world, whose heritage is in this life, and whom you make full with your secret wealth: they are full of children; after their death their offspring take the rest of their goods.
<ASV> And Balaam said to the ass, You have made me seem foolish: if only I had a sword in my hand I would put you to death.
<ASV> If, when he sees the sword coming on the land, by sounding the horn he gives the people news of their danger;
<ASV> Take away, then, his talent and give it to him who has the ten talents.
<ASV> If only a clean thing might come out of an unclean! But it is not possible.
<ASV> Esau's wives were women of Canaan: Adah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,
<ASV> Even so it is right for husbands to have love for their wives as for their bodies. He who has love for his wife has love for himself:
<ASV> Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. These are the sons of Ishmael.
<ASV> When you are not certain what will take place tomorrow. What is your life? It is a mist, which is seen for a little time and then is gone.
<ASV> Have no fear, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
<ASV> See, I am against you, says the Lord of armies, and I will have your war-carriages burned in the smoke, and your young lions will be food for the sword: you will no longer get your food by force on the earth, and the voice of your she-lions will be stopped for ever.
<ASV> I have knowledge of him because I came from him and he sent me.
<ASV> The earth is troubled before them and the heavens are shaking: the sun and the moon have become dark, and the stars keep back their shining:
<ASV> Let all the nations give praise to the Lord: let all the people give him praise.
<ASV> He who has the desire to keep his life will have it taken from him, and he who gives up his life because of me will have it given back to him.
<ASV> And it will come about in that day that the mountains will be dropping sweet wine, and the hills will be flowing with milk, and all the streams of Judah will be flowing with water; and a fountain will come out from the house of the Lord, watering the valley of acacia-trees.
<ASV> Rehum, the chief ruler, and Shimshai the scribe, sent a letter against Jerusalem, to Artaxerxes the king;
<ASV> But out of a branch from her roots one will come up to take his place, who will come against the army, forcing his way into the strong place of the king of the north, and he will take them in hand and overcome them:
<ASV> Do no wrong in your judging: do not give thought to the position of the poor, or honour to the position of the great; but be a judge to your neighbour in righteousness.
<ASV> A curse on the designers of evil, working on their beds! in the morning light they do it, because it is in their power.
<ASV> And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
<ASV> The children of Harim, three hundred and twenty.
<ASV> So then, if it is a question of food or drink, or any other thing, whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
<ASV> Then again one having the form of a man put his hand on me and gave me strength.
<ASV> For this cause I will again do a strange thing among this people, a thing to be wondered at: and the wisdom of their wise men will come to nothing, and the sense of their guides will no longer be seen.
<ASV> Then Joshua said to the priests, Take up the ark of the agreement and go over in front of the people. So they took up the ark of the agreement and went in front of the people.
<ASV> And say, This is what the Lord has said to Jerusalem: Your start and your birth was from the land of the Canaanite; an Amorite was your father and your mother was a Hittite.
<ASV> And again, measuring a thousand cubits, he made me go through the waters which came up to my knees. Again, measuring a thousand, he made me go through the waters up to the middle of my body.
<ASV> Who has gone into heaven, and is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers having been put under his rule.
<ASV> Why do these people of Jerusalem go back, for ever turning away? they will not give up their deceit, they will not come back.
<ASV> With the Lord our God are mercies and forgiveness, for we have gone against him;
<ASV> And give punishment seven times over into the breast of our neighbours for the bitter words which they have said against you, O Lord.
<ASV> My soul is dry for need of God, the living God; when may I come and see the face of God?
<ASV> And Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's people, I will go and give the news to Pharaoh, and say to him, My brothers and my father's people, from the land of Canaan, have come to me;
<ASV> And by his side the men of Jericho were building. And after them, Zaccur, the son of Imri.
<ASV> So now let my lord send to his servants the grain and the oil and the wine as my lord has said;
<ASV> Let not your face be veiled from me in the day of my trouble; give ear to me, and let my cry be answered quickly.
<ASV> So they put up the tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father's women before the eyes of all Israel.
<ASV> Go in by the narrow door; for wide is the door and open is the way which goes to destruction, and great numbers go in by it.
<ASV> He puts an end to wars over all the earth; by him the bow is broken, and the spear cut in two, and the carriage burned in the fire.
<ASV> For fear that through drinking they may come to have no respect for the law, wrongly judging the cause of those who are in trouble.
<ASV> For such people are not servants of the Lord Christ, but of their stomachs; and by their smooth and well-said words the hearts of those who have no knowledge of evil are tricked.
<ASV> Or if I send evil beasts through the land causing destruction and making it waste, so that no man may go through because of the beasts:
<ASV> The son of Amzi, the son of Bani, the son of Shemer,
<ASV> And their keepers went in flight to the town and gave an account of everything, and of the men who had the evil spirits.
<ASV> Now the false one had given them a sign saying, The one to whom I give a kiss, that is he: take him.
<ASV> He who goes about talking of others makes secrets public, but the true-hearted man keeps things covered.
<ASV> And being certain of this, it was my purpose to come to you before, so that you might have a second grace;
<ASV> You will make search for your haters but they will not be there; those who make war against you will be as nothing and will come to destruction.
<ASV> If the order of these things before me is ever broken, says the Lord, then will the seed of Israel come to an end as a nation before me for ever.
<ASV> For whoever has a desire to keep his life will have it taken from him, but whoever gives up his life because of me, will keep it.
<ASV> And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars; and on the earth, fear among the nations and doubt because of the loud noise of the sea and the waves;
<ASV> Bethuel was the father of Rebekah: these eight were the children of Milcah and Nahor, Abraham's brother.
<ASV> And the priest will take the cooked leg of the sheep and one unleavened cake and one thin cake out of the basket, and put them on the hands of the separate one after his hair has been cut,
<ASV> Say then to the children of Israel, I am Yahweh, and I will take you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians, and make you safe from their power, and will make you free by the strength of my arm after great punishments.
<ASV> About the children of Ammon. These are the words of the Lord: Has Israel no sons? has he no one to take the heritage? why then has Milcom taken Gad for himself, putting his people in its towns?
<ASV> If in his hate he put a sword through him, or waiting secretly for him sent a spear or stone at him, causing his death;
<ASV> For you have been my secret place, and my high tower from those who made war on me.
<ASV> Then God gave thought to Rachel, and hearing her prayer he made her fertile.
<ASV> Why are you crushed down, O my soul? and why are you troubled in me? put your hope in God; for I will again give him praise who is my help and my God.
<ASV> Because they went against the words of God, and gave no thought to the laws of the Most High:
<ASV> And now, Amariah, the chief priest, is over you in all questions to do with the Lord; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the head of the family of Judah, in everything to do with the king's business; and the Levites will be overseers for you. Be strong to do the work; and may the Lord be with the upright.
<ASV> Because our good news came to you, not in word only, but in power, and in the Holy Spirit, so that you were completely certain of it; even as you saw what our behaviour to you was like from our love to you.
<ASV> And when you get in the grain from your land, do not let all the grain at the edges of the field be cut, and do not take up the grain which has been dropped in the field; let that be for the poor, and for the man from another country: I am the Lord your God.
<ASV> Zadok his son, Ahimaaz his son.
<ASV> And if a man takes part in a competition he does not get the crown if he has not kept the rules.
<ASV> So keep the orders and the laws and the decisions which I give you today and do them.
<ASV> And he made the table of hard wood, two cubits long, a cubit wide and a cubit and a half high;
<ASV> Then they send up their cry to the Lord in their sorrow, and he gives them salvation out of all their troubles.
<ASV> So they said to him, Who are you then? We have to give some answer to those who sent us. What have you to say about yourself?
<ASV> Truly, because they had no faith they were broken off, and you have your place by reason of your faith. Do not be lifted up in pride, but have fear;
<ASV> Hearing the sound, a number of people who were there said that it was thunder: others said, An angel was talking to him.
<ASV> And, on your way, say, The kingdom of heaven is near.

<ASV> When I kept my mouth shut, my bones were wasted, because of my crying all through the day.

<ASV> These were the offerings given for the altar by the chiefs of Israel, when the holy oil was put on it: twelve silver plates, twelve silver basins, twelve gold spoons;
<ASV> And he said, I am God, the God of your father: go down to Egypt without fear, for I will make a great nation of you there:
<ASV> And those who are Christ's have put to death on the cross the flesh with its passions and its evil desires.
<ASV> And the Lord said to Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron when they took in strange fire before the Lord and death overtook them;
<ASV> Is it possible for a virgin to put out of her memory her ornaments, or a bride her robes? but my people have put me out of their memories for unnumbered days.

<ASV> Manasseh was making a meal of Ephraim, and Ephraim of Manasseh; and together they were attacking Judah. For all this his wrath is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
<ASV> Then the Lord said to Moses, Take all the chiefs of the people, hanging them up in the sun before the Lord, so that the wrath of the Lord may be turned from Israel.
<ASV> Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins, the friends of the bride, who took their lights, and went out with the purpose of meeting the husband.
<ASV> O Lord, keep a watch over my mouth; keep the door of my lips.
<ASV> When they went about from one nation to another, and from one kingdom to another people.
<ASV> Burning their offerings in all the high places, as those nations did whom the Lord sent away from before them; they did evil things, moving the Lord to wrath;
<ASV> For who has knowledge of the things of a man but the spirit of the man which is in him? in the same way, no one has knowledge of the things of God but the Spirit of God.
<ASV> You have seen my wanderings; put the drops from my eyes into your bottle; are they not in your record?

<ASV> And in the hill-country, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh;
<ASV> And some of those who were with us went to the place, and saw that it was as the women had said, but him they did not see.

<ASV> And in his wisdom he had his sons stationed in every walled town through all the lands of Judah and Benjamin; and he gave them a great store of food, and took wives for them.

<ASV> And for a time he would not: but later, he said to himself, Though I have no fear of God or respect for man,
<ASV> Then if anyone goes out of your house into the street, his blood will be on his head, we will not be responsible; but if any damage comes to anyone in the house, his blood will be on our heads.
<ASV> Because of this the Lord has given me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean in his eyes.
<ASV> In the same way, when you see these things taking place you may be certain that the kingdom of God is near.
<ASV> I have made a good fight, I have come to the end of my journey, I have kept the faith:
<ASV> I did not give attention to the voice of my teachers, my ear was not turned to those who were guiding me!

<ASV> And say to the people, Make yourselves clean before tomorrow and you will have flesh for your food: for in the ears of the Lord you have been weeping and saying, Who will give us flesh for food? for we were well off in Egypt: and so the Lord will give you flesh, and it will be your food;

<ASV> With you the horse and the horseman will be broken; with you the war-carriage and he who goes in it will be broken;
<ASV> So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, looking down over the waste land.
<ASV> For truly, I say to you that prophets and upright men had a desire to see the things which you see, and saw them not; and to have knowledge of the words which have come to your ears, and they had it not.
<ASV> And he gave it the name of Shibah: so the name of that town is Beer-sheba to this day.
<ASV> These are the men who make trouble, ever desiring change, going after evil pleasures, using high-sounding words, respecting men's position in the hope of reward.
<ASV> And even among these nations there will be no peace for you, and no rest for your feet: but the Lord will give you there a shaking heart and wasting eyes and weariness of soul:

<ASV> They had almost put an end to me on earth; but I did not give up your orders.

<ASV> Get up from your seats before the white-haired, and give honour to the old, and let the fear of your God be before you: I am the Lord.
<ASV> And Dilan, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel;
<ASV> The dead body of any of these, falling on anything, will make that thing unclean; if it is any vessel of wood, or clothing, or skin, or bag, whatever it is, if it is used for any purpose, it will have to be put into water, and will be unclean till evening; after that it will be clean.
<ASV> And they went into the hill-country and were there three days, till the men who had gone after them had come back; and those who went after them were searching for them everywhere without coming across them.
<ASV> And they said, What more need have we of witness? we have the very words of his mouth.
<ASV> Do not go after false gods, and do not make metal images of gods for yourselves: I am the Lord your God.
<ASV> They have said, With our tongues will we overcome; our lips are ours: who is lord over us?

<ASV> Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh, Moses had given a heritage in Bashan; but to the other half, Joshua gave a heritage among their brothers on the west side of Jordan. Now when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he gave them his blessing,
<ASV> And Abraham gave that place the name Yahweh-yireh: as it is said to this day, In the mountain the Lord is seen.
<ASV> But if a man makes an attack on his neighbour on purpose, to put him to death by deceit, you are to take him from my altar and put him to death.
<ASV> There is another who gives witness about me and I am certain that the witness he gives about me is true.
<ASV> For you have made a town a waste place: a strong town a mass of broken walls; the tower of the men of pride has come to an end; it will never be put up again.
<ASV> I will give you teaching about the hand of God; I will not keep secret from you what is in the mind of the Ruler of all.
<ASV> Say not to your neighbour, Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give; when you have it by you at the time.
<ASV> So the Lord has been watching over this evil and has made it come on us: for the Lord our God is upright in all his acts which he has done, and we have not given ear to his voice.
<ASV> And those who had food were about five thousand men, in addition to women and children.
<ASV> And the Lord God said, Now the man has become like one of us, having knowledge of good and evil; and now if he puts out his hand and takes of the fruit of the tree of life, he will go on living for ever.
<ASV> Their respect for a man's position is a witness against them; and their sin is open to the view of all; like that of Sodom, it is not covered. A curse on their soul! for the measure of their sin is full.
<ASV> But now I am going to him who sent me; and not one of you says to me, Where are you going?
<ASV> And Moses and Aaron did so: as the Lord gave them orders, so they did.
<ASV> A blessing on that servant, who will be doing so when his lord comes.
<ASV> With the hard work of your hands you will get your bread till you go back to the earth from which you were taken: for dust you are and to the dust you will go back.

<ASV> And these are the children of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
<ASV> Cursed is he who has sex relations with his mother-in-law. And let all the people say, So be it.
<ASV> Of Dan, Azarel, the son of Jeroham. These were the captains of the tribes of Israel.

<ASV> Then the king said to Haman, Go quickly, and take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, who is seated at the king's doorway: see that you do everything as you have said.

<ASV> For my love they give me back hate; but I have given myself to prayer.
<ASV> But when the upright man, turning away from his righteousness, does evil, like all the disgusting things which the evil man does, will he have life? Not one of his upright acts will be kept in memory: in the wrong which he has done and in his sin death will overtake him.
<ASV> We would have made Babylon well, but she is not made well: give her up, and let us go everyone to his country: for her punishment is stretching up to heaven, and lifted up even to the skies.
<ASV> Even as the witness of the Christ has been made certain among you:
<ASV> On the third day a man came from Saul's tents, with his clothing out of order and earth on his head: and when he came to David, he went down on the earth and gave him honour.
<ASV> And he is cutting down the thick places of the wood with an axe, and Lebanon with its tall trees is coming down.

<ASV> Let not your foot be frequently in your neighbour's house, or he may get tired of you, and his feeling be turned to hate.
<ASV> But the things which God had made clear before, by the mouth of all the prophets, that the Christ would have to undergo, he has put into effect in this way.

<ASV> The false heart I will send away from me: I will not have an evil-doer for a friend.

<ASV> Thirty camels with their young ones, forty cows, ten oxen, twenty asses, and ten young asses.
<ASV> &lt;A Psalm. Of David.&gt; The Lord takes care of me as his sheep; I will not be without any good thing.

<ASV> So has the Lord said: In Ramah there is a sound of crying, weeping and bitter sorrow; Rachel weeping for her children; she will not be comforted for their loss.
<ASV> Why do you make me see evil-doing, and why are my eyes fixed on wrong? for wasting and violent acts are before me: and there is fighting and bitter argument.
<ASV> And they took the Apostles and put them in the common prison.
<ASV> And no one takes note, no one has enough knowledge or wisdom to say, I have put part of it in the fire, and made bread on it; I have had a meal of the flesh cooked with it: and am I now to make the rest of it into a false god? am I to go down on my face before a bit of wood?
<ASV> And now you have been pleased to give your blessing to the family of your servant, so that it may go on for ever before you; you, O Lord, have given your blessing, and a blessing will be on it for ever.
<ASV> They said to him in answer, We are Abraham's seed and have never been any man's servant: why do you say, You will become free?
<ASV> Give ear, O Israel: today you are going forward to the fight; let your heart be strong; do not let uncontrolled fear overcome you because of those who are against you;

<ASV> Making no division between them and us, but making clean their hearts by faith.
<ASV> Then he made the support for the lights, all of the best gold; its base and its pillar were of hammered gold; its cups and buds and flowers were all made out of the same metal:
<ASV> There Abraham and Sarah his wife were put to rest, and there they put Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I put Leah to rest.
<ASV> So Haman was put to death by hanging him on the pillar he had made for Mordecai. Then the king's wrath became less.
<ASV> And you are to have the land marked out in seven parts, and come back to me with the record; and I will make the distribution for you here by the decision of the Lord our God.
<ASV> And when the seventh stamp was undone there was quiet in heaven for about half an hour.

<ASV> I will give your wealth and all your stores to be taken away in war without a price, because of your sins in every part of your land.
<ASV> For to one are given words of wisdom through the Spirit; and to another words of knowledge through the same Spirit:
<ASV> The evil-doers are strange from the first; from the hour of their birth they go out of the true way, saying false words.
<ASV> Any part of the dead body of one of these, falling on anything, will make it unclean; if it is an oven or a cooking-pot it will have to be broken: they are unclean and will be unclean to you.

<ASV> And Jesus said, And I will not make clear to you by what authority I do these things.
<ASV> And if the way is so long that you are not able to take these things to the place marked out by the Lord your God for his name, when he has given you his blessing, because it is far away from you;
<ASV> You have put an end to his glory: the seat of his kingdom has been levelled to the earth.
<ASV> He will come to his end for need of teaching; he is so foolish that he will go wandering from the right way.
<ASV> It may not be changed in any way, a good given for a bad, or a bad for a good; if one beast is changed for another, the two will be holy.

<ASV> And you are to give a lamb a year old without any mark on it for a burned offering to the Lord every day: morning by morning you are to give it.

<ASV> In the visions of my head on my bed I saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven,
<ASV> Him, when he was given up, by the decision and knowledge of God, you put to death on the cross, by the hands of evil men:
<ASV> Truly you are great, O Lord God: there is no one like you and no other God but you, as is clear from everything which has come to our ears.
<ASV> For this cause his net is ever open, and there is no end to his destruction of the nations.

<ASV> And David, hearing of it, sent Joab with all the army of fighting-men.

<ASV> So the children of Israel put up their tents in Gilgal; and they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, in the lowlands of Jericho.
<ASV> When they see your holy behaviour in the fear of God.
<ASV> And I will give grass in your fields for your cattle, so that you may have food in full measure.
<ASV> And at the sound of the people weeping, every man at his tent-door, the wrath of the Lord was great, and Moses was very angry.

<ASV> And Elisha the prophet sent for one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, Make yourself ready for a journey, and take this bottle of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead.
<ASV> And if the people of the land do not take note of that man when he gives his offspring to Molech, and do not put him to death,
<ASV> And they said to him, We have not had letters from Judaea about you, and no one of the brothers has come to us here to give an account or say any evil about you.
<ASV> In this way it is clear who are the children of God and who are the children of the Evil One; anyone who does not do righteousness or who has no love for his brother, is not a child of God.
<ASV> The children of Bigvai, two thousand and fifty-six.
<ASV> And then on the seventh day the child's death took place. And David's servants were in fear of giving him the news of the child's death: for they said, Truly, while the child was still living he gave no attention when we said anything to him: what will he do to himself if we give him word that the child is dead?
<ASV> The children go for wood, the fathers get the fire burning, the women are working the paste to make cakes for the queen of heaven, and drink offerings are drained out to other gods, moving me to wrath.
<ASV> O give worship to the Lord in holy robes; be in fear before him, all the earth.
<ASV> And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and became sad and very troubled.
<ASV> For the rule is a light, and the teaching a shining light; and the guiding words of training are the way of life.
<ASV> ... against the regular burned offering; and ... crushed down to the earth, and it did its pleasure and things went well for it.
<ASV> So will the king have a great desire for you, seeing how beautiful you are; because he is your lord, give him honour.
<ASV> For this cause I will make my name clear to my people; in that day they will be certain that it is my word which comes to them; see, here am I.
<ASV> But God gives it a body, as it is pleasing to him, and to every seed its special body.
<ASV> But if you say anything about our business here, then we will be free from the oath you have made us take.
<ASV> But gold and silver and brass and iron and tin and lead,
<ASV> In the waste land, Beth-arabah, Middin, and Secacah;
<ASV> But he says, No, for fear that by chance while you take up the evil plants, you may be rooting up the grain with them.
<ASV> You were in Eden, the garden of God; every stone of great price was your clothing, the sardius, the topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the emerald and the carbuncle: your store-houses were full of gold, and things of great price were in you; in the day when you were made they were got ready.
<ASV> Then John sent two of his disciples to the Lord, saying, Are you he who is to come, or are we waiting for another?
<ASV> And they said much before me of the good he had done, and gave him accounts of my words. And Tobiah sent letters with the purpose of causing me fear.
<ASV> You are to say to Joseph, Let the wrongdoing of your brothers be overlooked, and the evil they did to you: now, if it is your pleasure, let the sin of the servants of your father's God have forgiveness. And at these words, Joseph was overcome with weeping.

<ASV> For they will quickly be cut down like grass, and become dry like the green plants.
<ASV> And Philip, running up to him, saw that he was reading Isaiah the prophet, and said to him, Is the sense of what you are reading clear to you?
<ASV> For a number of nations and great kings will make servants of them, even of them: and I will give them the reward of their acts, even the reward of the work of their hands.

<ASV> And Jacob sent for his sons, and said, Come together, all of you, so that I may give you news of your fate in future times.
<ASV> So, as a prophet, give out these words among them, and say to them, The voice of the Lord will be sounding like a lion from on high; he will send out his voice from his holy place, like the loud voice of a lion, against his flock; he will give a cry, like those who are crushing the grapes, against all the people of the earth.
<ASV> And that you may take pride in being quiet and doing your business, working with your hands as we gave you orders;
<ASV> And David says, Let their table be made a net for taking them, and a stone in their way, and a punishment:
<ASV> And Elihu went on to say,
<ASV> These are the families of the Zebulunites as they were numbered, sixty thousand, five hundred.

<ASV> But still the high places were not taken away; the people went on making offerings and burning them in the high places.

<ASV> And is cruel to the other servants, taking his pleasure with those who are overcome with wine;

<ASV> And those who are living in the towns of Israel will go out and make fires of the instruments of war, burning the body-covers and the breastplates, the bows and the arrows and the sticks and the spears, and for seven years they will make fires of them:
<ASV> And I saw when the Lamb undid one of the stamps, and the voice of one of the four beasts came to my ears, saying as with a voice of thunder, Come and see.
<ASV> And the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and body-covers which had been King David's, and which were kept in the house of the Lord.

<ASV> And one he-goat for a sin-offering; in addition to the regular burned offering, and its meal offering, and its drink offering.

<ASV> O you whose living-place is by the wide waters, whose stores are great, your end is come, your evil profit is ended.
<ASV> Their sorrows will be increased who go after another god: I will not take drink offerings from their hands, or take their names on my lips.
<ASV> It is not enough for one who is my servant to put the tribes of Jacob again in their place, and to get back those of Israel who have been sent away: my purpose is to give you as a light to the nations, so that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.
<ASV> Your teeth are like a flock of sheep whose wool is newly cut, which come up from the washing; every one has two lambs, and there is not one without young.
<ASV> Because if any man is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a glass;
<ASV> They will take dust as their food like a snake, like the things which go flat on the earth; they will come shaking with fear out of their secret places: they will come with fear to the Lord our God, full of fear because of you.
<ASV> And news of them came to the ears of the church at Jerusalem: and they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch:
<ASV> And they come to you as my people come, and are seated before you as my people, hearing your words but doing them not: for deceit is in their mouth and their heart goes after profit for themselves.
<ASV> Then will he say to those on the left, Go from me, you cursed ones, into the eternal fire which is ready for the Evil One and his angels:

<ASV> Three times I was whipped with rods, once I was stoned, three times the ship I was in came to destruction at sea, a night and a day I have been in the water;

<ASV> For the priests who took up the ark kept there in the middle of Jordan till all the orders given to Joshua by Moses from the Lord had been done: then the people went over quickly.
<ASV> Then you went over Jordan and came to Jericho: and the men of Jericho made war on you, the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Girgashites and the Hivites and the Jebusites: and I gave them up into your hands.
<ASV> When he made strong the skies overhead: when the fountains of the deep were fixed:
<ASV> Five of these curtains are to be joined together, and the other six are to be joined together, the sixth being folded over to make a hanging in front of the tent.
<ASV> And all lands sent to Egypt, to Joseph, to get grain, for the need was great over all the earth.
<ASV> And Korah made all the people come together against them to the door of the Tent of meeting: and the glory of the Lord was seen by all the people.
<ASV> After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples, and they were there not more than two or three days.
<ASV> For this, my son, who was dead, is living again; he had gone away from me, and has come back. And they were full of joy.
<ASV> May the mountains give peace to the people, and the hills righteousness.
<ASV> In the morning give us your mercy in full measure; so that we may have joy and delight all our days.
<ASV> For the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said, There will again be trading in houses and fields and vine-gardens in this land.
<ASV> And answering a second time, I said to him, What are these two olive branches, through whose gold pipes the oil is drained out?
<ASV> We put our lives in danger to get our bread, because of the sword of the waste land.
<ASV> Say to the children of Israel, Let certain towns be marked out as safe places, as I said to you by the mouth of Moses,
<ASV> Which is his body, the full measure of him in whom all things are made complete.
<ASV> In my trouble I was crying to the Lord, and he gave me an answer; out of the deepest underworld I sent up a cry, and you gave ear to my voice.

<ASV> Now the Lord said to Abram, Go out from your country and from your family and from your father's house, into the land to which I will be your guide:
<ASV> You have mercy on thousands, and send punishment for the evil-doing of the fathers on their children after them: the great, the strong God, the Lord of armies is his name:
<ASV> By him my ways have been turned on one side and I have been pulled in bits; he has made me waste.
<ASV> Israel has given up what is good; his haters will go after him.
<ASV> For this cause I will give you up to the children of the east for their heritage, and they will put their tent-circles in you and make their houses in you; they will take your fruit for their food and your milk for their drink.
<ASV> The rest of the dead did not come to life again till the thousand years were ended. This is the first coming back from the dead.
<ASV> And early in the morning he came again into the Temple and all the people came to him and he was seated teaching them.
<ASV> Who gave you manna for your food in the waste land, a food which your fathers had never seen; so that your pride might be broken and your hearts tested for your good in the end;
<ASV> But when it is turned to the Lord, the veil will be taken away.
<ASV> For this reason in one day will her troubles come, death and sorrow and need of food; and she will be completely burned with fire; for strong is the Lord God who is her judge.
<ASV> I said before, and still say it before I come, as being present for the second time, though I am still away from you, to those who have done wrong before, and to all the others, that if I come again I will not have pity;
<ASV> Then will the upright make answer to him, saying, Lord, when did we see you in need of food, and give it to you? or in need of drink, and give it to you?
<ASV> Her ways are ways of delight, and all her goings are peace.
<ASV> It was on the day when the Lord gave up the Amorites into the hands of the children of Israel that Joshua said to the Lord, before the eyes of Israel, Sun, be at rest over Gibeon; and you, O moon, in the valley of Aijalon.
<ASV> And the young men went and made ready his body, and took it out, and put it in the earth.
<ASV> For the earth is the Lord's and all things in it.
<ASV> Making distribution among one another of whatever has been given to you, like true servants of the unmeasured grace of God;
<ASV> And the sons of Hotham, his brother: Zophah and Imna and Shelesh and Amal.
<ASV> And I will put a fire in Egypt; Syene will be twisting in pain, and No will be broken into, as by the onrush of waters.
<ASV> He is the chief of the ways of God, made by him for his pleasure.
<ASV> And on the top of the arch which was over their heads was the form of a king's seat, like a sapphire stone; and on the form of the seat was the form of a man seated on it on high.
<ASV> (He had knowledge who was false to him; that is why he said, You are not all clean.)
<ASV> Then I saw all the works which my hands had made, and everything I had been working to do; and I saw that all was to no purpose and desire for wind, and there was no profit under the sun.
<ASV> And second only to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven rulers of Persia and Media, who were friends of the king, and had the first places in the kingdom:)
<ASV> A king's glory is in the number of his people: and for need of people a ruler may come to destruction.
<ASV> In that day, one who has got away safe will come to you to give you news of it.
<ASV> And the scribes and Pharisees were watching him to see if he would make him well on the Sabbath, so that they might be able to say something against him.
<ASV> He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, copying the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, which he did and made Israel do; he did not keep himself from them.
<ASV> I will give you into their hands, and your arched room will be overturned and your high places broken down; they will take your clothing off you and take away your fair jewels: and when they have done, you will be uncovered and shamed.
<ASV> And the sons of Tola: Uzzi and Rephaiah and Jeriel and Jahmai and Ibsam and Shemuel, heads of their families; they were men of war; in the record of their generations their number in the time of David was twenty-two thousand, six hundred.
<ASV> And the wonder-workers with their secret arts, attempting to make insects, were unable to do so: and there were insects on man and on beast.

<ASV> Now to give me back payment of the same sort (I am talking as to my children), let your hearts be wide open to me.
<ASV> So I gave praise to joy, because there is nothing better for a man to do under the sun than to take meat and drink and be happy; for that will be with him in his work all the days of his life which God gives him under the sun.
<ASV> But he made answer and said to his father, See, all these years I have been your servant, doing your orders in everything: and you never gave me even a young goat so that I might have a feast with my friends:
<ASV> I am the bread of life.
<ASV> And he went and put himself into the hands of one of the people of that country, and he sent him into his fields to give the pigs their food.
<ASV> I have seen your disgusting acts, even your false behaviour and your cries of desire and your loose ways on the hills in the field. Unhappy are you, O Jerusalem, you have no desire to be made clean; how long will you be in turning back to me?
<ASV> Till the Lord has given your brothers rest, as he has given it to you, and they have taken their heritage in the land which the Lord your God is giving them: then you will go back to the land of your heritage which Moses, the servant of the Lord, gave you on the east side of Jordan.
<ASV> I will make my flock safe, and they will no longer be taken away, and I will be judge between sheep and sheep.
<ASV> Let no man go to law or make protests, for your people are like those who go to law with a priest.

<ASV> Then he came to the doorway looking to the east, and went up by its steps; and he took the measure of the doorstep, one rod wide.
<ASV> Which he gave us in full measure in all wisdom and care;
<ASV> Peres; your kingdom has been cut up and given to the Medes and Persians.
<ASV> The Lord is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation.
<ASV> &lt;RESH&gt; O see my trouble, and be my saviour; for I keep your law in my mind,
<ASV> So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and the Lord made her with child and she gave birth to a son.
<ASV> And he is to take away its stomach, with its feathers, and put it down by the east side of the altar, where the burned waste is put:
<ASV> And the angel said to her, Go back, and put yourself under her authority.
<ASV> I have sent you this short letter by Silvanus, a true brother, in my opinion; comforting you and witnessing that this is the true grace of God; keep to it.
<ASV> O Lord, your name is eternal; and the memory of you will have no end.
<ASV> And when all things have been put under him, then will the Son himself be under him who put all things under him, so that God may be all in all.
<ASV> At that time, says the Lord, I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they will be my people.
<ASV> So they went out of the town and came to him.
<ASV> But the mother of the child said, As the Lord is living and as your soul is living, I will not go back without you. So he got up and went with her.
<ASV> No part of these things has been used for food in a time of weeping, or put away when I was unclean, or given for the dead: I have given ear to the voice of the Lord my God, and have done all you have given me orders to do.
<ASV> How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we were living in Egypt for a long time; and the Egyptians were cruel to us and to our fathers:
<ASV> And the Lord said, Have you any right to be angry?
<ASV> Sorrow is yours, O Moab! Destruction is your fate, O people of Chemosh: his sons have gone in flight, and his daughters are prisoners, in the hands of Sihon, king of the Amorites.
<ASV> And the woman of Tekoa came to the king, and falling on her face, gave him honour and said, Give me help, O king.
<ASV> Then I gave an account to those who had been taken prisoners of all the things which the Lord had made me see.
<ASV> So that glory may be given to the name of our Lord Jesus through you, and you may have glory in him, by the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<ASV> I still had faith, though I said, I am in great trouble;
<ASV> But it will be like a man shaking an olive-tree, something will still be there, two or three berries on the top of the highest branch, four or five on the outside branches of a fertile tree, says the Lord, the God of Israel.
<ASV> And the Lord said to Moses, Put Aaron's rod back in front of the ark of witness, to be kept for a sign against this false-hearted people, so that you may put a stop to their outcries against me, and death may not overtake them.
<ASV> But there was a certain man named Simon, who in the past had been a wonder-worker and a cause of surprise to the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was a great man:
<ASV> And they went to the opening into Gedor, as far as the east side of the valley, in search of grass-land for their flocks.
<ASV> And in this way, doing evil to the brothers, and causing trouble to those whose faith is feeble, you are sinning against Christ.
<ASV> And he took me out into the inner square in the direction of the north: and he took me into the rooms which were opposite the separate place and opposite the building to the north.
<ASV> And they came to the valley of Eshcol, and cutting down a vine-branch with its grapes, two of them took it on a rod between them; and they took some pomegranates and figs.
<ASV> Take the first-fruits of your land as an offering to the house of the Lord your God. Let not the young goat be cooked in its mother's milk
<ASV> He who goes in by the door is the keeper of the sheep.
<ASV> But we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel till we have taken them to their place: but our little ones will be safe in the walled towns against the people of the land.
<ASV> And he said to me, Son of man, make a hole in the wall: and after making a hole in the wall I saw a door.
<ASV> He who is watching the wind will not get the seed planted, and he who is looking at the clouds will not get in the grain.
<ASV> And Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, went back to his house in Jerusalem in peace.
<ASV> These are the words of the Lord of armies: Put now a point of law to the priests, saying,
<ASV> O troubled one, storm-crushed, uncomforted! see, your stones will be framed in fair colours, and your bases will be sapphires.
<ASV> When blows overtake the man of pride, the simple will get sense; say sharp words to the wise, and knowledge will be made clear to him.
<ASV> Saying, Where is the King of the Jews whose birth has now taken place? We have seen his star in the east and have come to give him worship.
<ASV> Ho! uncontrolled children, says the Lord, who give effect to a purpose which is not mine, and who make an agreement, but not by my spirit, increasing their sin:
<ASV> But you, my loved ones, keep in memory the words which were said before by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,
<ASV> And the rooms in it and the uprights and the covered ways, by these measures:
<ASV> Acting on their suggestion, he went with Jehoram, son of Ahab, king of Israel, to make war on Hazael, king of Aram, at Ramoth-gilead: and Joram was wounded by the bowmen.
<ASV> All who are with me send you their love. Give our love to our friends in the faith. Grace be with you all.
<ASV> But sinners will be cut off from the land, and those whose acts are false will be uprooted.
<ASV> And take Aaron's robes off him and put them on Eleazar, his son: and death will come to Aaron there, and he will be put to rest with his people.
<ASV> And this was the part marked out for the tribe of Manasseh, because he was the oldest son of Joseph. As for Machir, the oldest son of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war he had Gilead and Bashan.
<ASV> But they were not able to get the better of him, for his words were full of wisdom and of the Spirit.
<ASV> So that place was named Taberah, because of the fire of the Lord which had been burning among them.
<ASV> For they made the blood of saints and prophets come out like a stream, and blood have you given them for drink; which is their right reward.
<ASV> The outcry of the children of Israel has come to my ears: say to them now, At nightfall you will have meat for your food, and in the morning bread in full measure; and you will see that I am the Lord your God.
<ASV> Let another man give you praise, and not your mouth; one who is strange to you, and not your lips.
<ASV> His left hand would be under my head, and his right hand about me.
<ASV> Till the memory of what you have done to him is past and he is no longer angry: then I will send word for you to come back; are the two of you to be taken from me in one day?
<ASV> I will let the swords of the strong be the cause of the fall of your people; all of them men to be feared among the nations: and they will make waste the pride of Egypt, and all its people will come to destruction.
<ASV> And I will make you a heritage for the hedgehog, and pools of water: and I will go through it with the brush of destruction, says the Lord of armies.
<ASV> For your sorrow will go from your memory, like waters flowing away:
<ASV> What is that headstone I see over there? And the men of the town said to him, It is the resting-place of the man of God who came from Judah and gave word of all these things which you have done to the altar of Beth-el.
<ASV> Who in the past was of no profit to you, but now is of profit to you and to me:
<ASV> I will certainly make all of you, O Jacob, come together; I will get together the rest of Israel; I will put them together like the sheep in their circle: like a flock in their green field; they will be full of the noise of men.
<ASV> And with the sandal-wood the king made steps for the house of the Lord and for the king's house, and instruments of music for the makers of melody; never before had such been seen in the land of Judah.
<ASV> For the one living in Maroth is waiting for good: for evil has come down from the Lord to the doorways of Jerusalem.
<ASV> While David was in Hebron he became the father of sons: the oldest was Amnon, son of Ahinoam of Jezreel;
<ASV> Because he had been ordered to keep inside the safe town till the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the taker of life may come back to the place of his heritage.
<ASV> All the ends of the earth will keep it in mind and be turned to the Lord: all the families of the nations will give him worship.
<ASV> The grey head is a crown of glory, if it is seen in the way of righteousness.
<ASV> And make all its vessels, the baskets for taking away the dust of the fire, the spades and basins and meat-hooks and fire-trays, of brass.
<ASV> In the past you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; then there was no mercy for you, but now mercy has been given to you.
<ASV> For they have all come to an agreement; they are all joined together against you:
<ASV> And they gave by the Lord's decision out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, and out of the tribe of the children of Benjamin, these towns whose names are given.
<ASV> And all the people went on by his side; and all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites and all the men of Ittai of Gath, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, went on before the king.
<ASV> I went by the field of the hater of work, and by the vine-garden of the man without sense;
<ASV> And again in a dream I saw seven heads of grain, full and good, coming up on one stem:
<ASV> And he will have the war-carriage cut off from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of war will be cut off: and he will say words of peace to the nations: and his rule will be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.
<ASV> And it came about, when he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer put him to death with the sword; and they went in flight into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son became king in his place.
<ASV> The wounds of a friend are given in good faith, but the kisses of a hater are false.
<ASV> The children of Ephraim, armed with bows, were turned back on the day of the fight.
<ASV> And David said to Joab and all the people who were with him, Go in grief and put haircloth about you, in sorrow for Abner. And King David went after the dead body.

<ASV> Then the Jews came round him, saying, how long are you going to keep us in doubt? If you are the Christ, say so clearly.
<ASV> Your wife will be like a fertile vine in the inmost parts of your house: your children will be like olive plants round your table.
<ASV> The upright town has become untrue; there was a time when her judges gave right decisions, when righteousness had a resting-place in her, but now she is full of those who take men's lives.
<ASV> And the shekel is to be twenty gerahs: five shekels are five, and ten shekels are ten, and your maneh is to be fifty shekels
<ASV> The sons of Ham: Cush and Egypt, Put and Canaan.
<ASV> And the rest of Israel, of the priests, the Levites, were in all the towns of Judah, every one in his heritage.
<ASV> If a young virgin has given her word to be married to a man, and another man meeting her in the town, has connection with her;
<ASV> As for the form of their faces, they were the faces whose form I saw by the river Chebar; when they went, every one of them went straight forward.
<ASV> Then men will say, Because they gave up the agreement of the Lord, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he took them out of the land of Egypt:
<ASV> Judging uprightly in the cause of the widow and of the child who has no father, and giving food and clothing in his mercy to the man from a strange country.
<ASV> But as for you, keep your place here by me, and I will give you all the orders and the laws and the decisions which you are to make clear to them, so that they may do them in the land which I am giving them for their heritage.
<ASV> For the band of the evil-doers gives no fruit, and the tents of those who give wrong decisions for reward are burned with fire.
<ASV> God has gone up with a glad cry, the Lord with the sound of the horn.
<ASV> We go on our way, like blind men feeling for the wall, even like those who have no eyes: we are running against things in daylight as if it was evening; our place is in the dark like dead men.
<ASV> And whoever makes a peace-offering to the Lord, in payment of an oath or as a free offering, from the herd or the flock, if it is to be pleasing to the Lord, let it be free from any mark or damage.
<ASV> Then the earth was moved with a violent shock; the bases of heaven were moved and shaking, because he was angry.
<ASV> The Lord is ready to take up his cause against his people, and is about to come forward as their judge.
<ASV> To give the revelation of his Son in me, so that I might give the news of him to the Gentiles; then I did not take the opinion of flesh and blood,
<ASV> And the disciples went and did as Jesus had given them orders,
<ASV> Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of wrath, and the form of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: and he gave orders that the fire was to be heated up seven times more than it was generally heated.
<ASV> And they have made little of the wounds of my people, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.

<ASV> And with him they sent ten chiefs, one for every tribe of the children of Israel, every one of them the head of his house among the families of Israel.
<ASV> But when they had faith in the good news given by Philip about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, a number of men and women had baptism.

<ASV> And Moses sent for all Israel, and said to them, Give ear, O Israel, to the laws and the decisions which I give you today, and give attention to them so that you may keep and do them.
<ASV> The eyes of the Lord are in every place, keeping watch on the evil and the good.
<ASV> By whom we come near to God without fear through faith in him.
<ASV> The children of the other Elam, a thousand, two hundred and fifty-four.
<ASV> But if the servant says clearly, My master and my wife and children are dear to me; I have no desire to be free:
<ASV> And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brothers and their sons, twenty;
<ASV> Because out of a prison the young man comes to be king, though by birth he was only a poor man in the kingdom.
<ASV> And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, came to David, and falling down on his face, gave him honour. And David said, Mephibosheth. And answering he said, Your servant is here.

<ASV> But he will let the living bird go out of the town into the open country; so he will take away sin from the house and it will be clean.

<ASV> Then the woman became with child and gave birth to a son at the time named, in the year after, as Elisha had said to her.
<ASV> But the ox, with its skin and its flesh and its waste, was burned with fire outside the tent-circle, as the Lord gave orders to Moses.
<ASV> And a number came to have faith in him there.
<ASV> Two of every sort of bird and cattle and of every sort of living thing which goes on the earth will you take with you to keep them from destruction.
<ASV> Any four-footed beast which goes on the ball of its foot, is unclean to you: anyone touching the dead body of one of these will be unclean till evening.
<ASV> Then the wrath of the Lord was burning against his people, and he was angry with his heritage.
<ASV> It gives me great joy to see you answering to my good opinion of you in every way.
<ASV> And he got back all the goods, and Lot, his brother's son, with his goods and the women and the people.

<ASV> He makes your mouth full of good things, so that your strength is made new again like the eagle's.
<ASV> And Abraham was the father of Isaac. The sons of Isaac: Esau and Israel.
<ASV> We are certain that God gave his word to Moses: but as for this man, we have no knowledge where he comes from.
<ASV> And Mishma and Dumah and Massa,
<ASV> Which is not another sort: only there are some who give you trouble, desiring to make changes in the good news of Christ.
<ASV> And I said to them, Do not let the doors of Jerusalem be open till the sun is high; and while the watchmen are in their places, let the doors be shut and locked: and let the people of Jerusalem be put on watch, every one in his watch, opposite his house.
<ASV> And one of the seven angels who had the seven vessels came and said to me, Come here, so that you may see the judging of the evil woman who is seated on the great waters;
<ASV> The traders of Sheba and Raamah did trade with you; they gave the best of all sorts of spices and all sorts of stones of great price and gold for your goods.
<ASV> Jesus said in answer, It was not because of his sin, or because of his father's or mother's; it was so that the works of God might be seen openly in him.
<ASV> One comes to his end in complete well-being, full of peace and quiet:
<ASV> When the Most High put the kings to flight, it was as white as snow in Salmon.
<ASV> But some of them went to the Pharisees with the news of what Jesus had done.
<ASV> And he said to me, The waters which you saw, where the evil woman is seated, are peoples, and armies, and nations and languages.
<ASV> To be a sign, kept in memory for ever by the children of Israel, that no man who is not of the seed of Aaron has the right of burning spices before the Lord, so that he may not be like Korah and his band: as the Lord said to him by the mouth of Moses.
<ASV> And Mary said: My soul gives glory to God;

<ASV> Then the people of the land made the hands of the people of Judah feeble, troubling them with fear in their building;
<ASV> Say now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, ruler of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the rest of the people,
<ASV> For if you give a blessing with the spirit, how will the man who has no knowledge say, So be it, after your prayer, seeing that he has not taken in what you are saying?
<ASV> But if you give the evil-doer word of his danger, and he is not turned from his sin or from his evil way, death will overtake him in his evil-doing; but your life will be safe.
<ASV> And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan;
<ASV> Then Absalom said, If you will not go, then let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Is there any reason for him to go with you?

<ASV> Sheba, and Dedan and her traders, Tarshish with all her traders, will say to you, Have you come to take our goods? have you got your armies together to take away our property by force? to take away silver and gold, cattle and goods, to go off with great wealth?
<ASV> And after he had said these words to me, I kept my face turned to the earth and was unable to say anything.
<ASV> That all living things will be made free from the power of death and will have a part with the free children of God in glory.

<ASV> And the design of all he had in his heart for the outer squares of the house of the Lord, and for the rooms all round it, and for the store-houses of the house of the Lord, and for the store-houses for the holy things;
<ASV> So the priests made an agreement to take no more money from the people, and not to make good what was damaged in the house.
<ASV> These are the words of the Lord: For three crimes of Israel, and for four, I will not let its fate be changed; because they have given the upright man for silver, and the poor for the price of two shoes;

<ASV> And the responsible men of the Jews went on with their building, and did well, helped by the teaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, the son of Iddo.

<ASV> Let there be fear in your hearts, and do no sin; have bitter feelings on your bed, but make no sound. (Selah.)
<ASV> And to the wall-builders and the stone-cutters, and to get wood and cut stone for building up the broken parts of the house of the Lord, and for everything needed to put the house in good order.

<ASV> And when the men of that place had news of him, they sent into all the country round about, and took to him all who were ill,
<ASV> Then you will take the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters for food;
<ASV> For now my steps are numbered by you, and my sin is not overlooked.
<ASV> The four and twenty rulers go down on their faces before him who is seated on the high seat, and give worship to him who is living for ever and ever, and take off their crowns before the high seat, saying,

<ASV> For this cause, O keepers of the flock, give ear to the word of the Lord:
<ASV> For there will never be a time when there are no poor in the land; and so I give orders to you, Let your hand be open to your countrymen, to those who are poor and in need in your land.
<ASV> I am the Lord, your Holy One, the Maker of Israel, your King.
<ASV> The fifth Malchijah, the sixth Mijamin,
<ASV> Son of man, let your face be turned to the south, let your words be dropped to the south, and be a prophet against the woodland of the South;
<ASV> One male of the goats for a sin-offering;
<ASV> You have made your agreement with your servant of no effect: you have had no respect for his crown, it has come down even to the earth.
<ASV> He will put to the sword your daughters in the open country: he will make strong walls against you and put up an earthwork against you, arming himself for war against you.
<ASV> You have no part in this business, because your heart is not right before God.
<ASV> For it is not right for the Lord's servant to make trouble, but he is to be gentle to all, ready in teaching, putting up with wrong,
<ASV> If then God gave them, when they had faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, the same as he gave to us, who was I to go against God?
<ASV> Seeing that you are looking for a sign of Christ giving out his word in me; who is not feeble in relation to you, but is strong in you:

<ASV> And of the sons of Issachar: Tola and Puah, Jashub and Shimron, four.

<ASV> And you are to say further, Jacob, your servant, is coming after us. For he said to himself, I will take away his wrath by the offering which I have sent on, and then I will come before him: it may be that I will have grace in his eyes.
<ASV> This I say, then, and give witness in the Lord, that you are to go no longer in the way of the Gentiles whose minds are turned to that which has no profit,
<ASV> And a certain poor man, named Lazarus, was stretched out at his door, full of wounds,
<ASV> But Paul said to the captain and his men, If you do not keep these men in the ship, you will not be safe.

<ASV> If, in that very minute, it does evil in my eyes, going against my orders, then my good purpose, which I said I would do for them, will be changed.
<ASV> After these things I saw a great army of people more than might be numbered, out of every nation and of all tribes and peoples and languages, taking their places before the high seat and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes, and with branches in their hands,

<ASV> But Jesus, who had knowledge of their thoughts, said to them, Why are you reasoning in your hearts?

<ASV> No disgusting thing may be your food.
<ASV> Let us go out early to the vine-gardens; let us see if the vine is in bud, if it has put out its young fruit, and the pomegranate is in flower. There I will give you my love.

<ASV> The day after, a great number of people who were there for the feast, when they had the news that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
<ASV> When the people of the land where you are going have been cut off before you by the Lord your God, and you have taken their land and are living in it;
<ASV> Who take the property of widows and before the eyes of men make long prayers; they will get a greater punishment.

<ASV> Then Judah said openly that they were his, and said, She is more upright than I am, for I did not give her to Shelah my son. And he had no more connection with her.

<ASV> See! as the eyes of servants are turned to the hands of their masters, and the eyes of a servant-girl to her owner, so our eyes are waiting for the Lord our God, till he has mercy on us.

<ASV> Cursed are those who get up early in the morning to give themselves up to strong drink; who keep on drinking far into the night till they are heated with wine!
<ASV> And the Lord said to Moses,
<ASV> And I will send you in flight among the nations and wandering among the countries; and I will completely take away out of you everything which is unclean.

<ASV> That you put my children to death and gave them up to go through the fire to them?
<ASV> Now this was the third time that Jesus let himself be seen by the disciples after he had come back from the dead.
<ASV> Then on that day David first made the giving of praise to the Lord the work of Asaph and his brothers.
<ASV> And he is to take the ox to the door of the Tent of meeting before the Lord; and put his hand on its head and put it to death before the Lord.

<ASV> Let there be no hate in your heart for your brother; but you may make a protest to your neighbour, so that he may be stopped from doing evil.
<ASV> Then the Lord said to Joshua, Have no fear and do not be troubled: take with you all the fighting-men and go up against Ai: for I have given into your hands the king of Ai and his people and his town and his land:
<ASV> These were the potters, and the people living among planted fields with walls round them; they were there to do the king's work.
<ASV> And from there, going about in a curve, we came to Rhegium: and after one day a south wind came up and on the day after we came to Puteoli:
<ASV> He who has the power of comforting, let him do so; he who gives, let him give freely; he who has the power of ruling, let him do it with a serious mind; he who has mercy on others, let it be with joy.

<ASV> If my steps have been turned out of the way, or if my heart went after my eyes, or if the property of another is in my hands;
<ASV> And this was done by all the rulers and the people who had taken part in the agreement, and every one let his man-servant and his servant-girl go free, not to be used as servants any longer; they did so, and let them go.
<ASV> But his lord in answer said to him, You are a bad and unready servant; if you had knowledge that I get in grain where I did not put seed, and make profits for which I have done no work,
<ASV> And Moses said to Joshua, Get together a band of men for us and go out, make war on Amalek: tomorrow I will take my place on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.
<ASV> Taking care to keep the harmony of the Spirit in the yoke of peace.
<ASV> Let not your servant come before you to be judged; for no man living is upright in your eyes.
<ASV> And he said, No; but I have come as captain of the armies of the Lord. Then Joshua, falling down with his face to the earth in worship, said, What has my lord to say to his servant?

<ASV> But there is a God in heaven, the unveiler of secrets, and he has given to King Nebuchadnezzar knowledge of what will take place in the last days. Your dreams and the visions of your head on your bed are these:
<ASV> As for you, you will go to your fathers in peace; at the end of a long life you will be put in your last resting-place.

<ASV> For he who was a servant when he became a Christian is the Lord's free man; and he who was free when he became a Christian is the Lord's servant.
<ASV> For the images have said what is not true, and the readers of signs have seen deceit; they have given accounts of false dreams, they give comfort to no purpose: so they go out of the way like sheep, they are troubled because they have no keeper.
<ASV> The top and the sides and the horns were all plated with the best gold; and he put an edge of gold all round it.
<ASV> All the house was plated with gold, the supports, the steps, the walls and the doors; and the walls were ornamented with designs of winged ones.
<ASV> And those who went by said bitter words to him, shaking their heads and saying,
<ASV> Make clear then to them, as representatives of the churches, the quality of your love, and that the things which we have said about you are true.
<ASV> Righteousness will go before him, making a way for his footsteps.
<ASV> And I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, burning up its great houses:
<ASV> For then I might have gone to my rest in quiet, and in sleep have been in peace,
<ASV> Because we are certain that he who made the Lord Jesus come back from the dead, will do the same for us, and will give us a place in his glory with you.
<ASV> But the judge will be seated, and they will put an end to his authority, to overcome it and send complete destruction on it.
<ASV> And on all the ships of Tarshish, and on all the fair boats.
<ASV> Then Joseph's heart went out to his brother, and he went quickly into his room, for he was overcome with weeping.
<ASV> Food enough for his young and for his she-lions was pulled down by the lion; his hole was full of flesh and his resting-place stored with meat.
<ASV> Is it not to give your bread to those in need, and to let the poor who have no resting-place come into your house? to put a robe on the unclothed one when you see him, and not to keep your eyes shut for fear of seeing his flesh?
<ASV> But they have been walking in the pride of their hearts, going after the Baals, as their fathers gave them teaching.
<ASV> But no such payment may be made for the first birth of an ox or a sheep or a goat; these are holy: their blood is to be dropped on the altar, and their fat burned for an offering made by fire, a sweet smell to the Lord.
<ASV> Now she had on a long robe, such as in past times the king's virgin daughters were dressed in. Then the servant put her out, locking the door after her.
<ASV> These were heads of families in their generations; chief men: these were living in Jerusalem.
<ASV> And some went on the rock, and when it came up it became dry and dead because it had no water.
<ASV> Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king; and he was ruling for two years in Jerusalem.
<ASV> And they will come up like grass in a well-watered field, like water-plants by the streams.
<ASV> Let no wrong decisions be given in the poor man's cause.
<ASV> Seeing that Abraham will certainly become a great and strong nation, and his name will be used by all the nations of the earth as a blessing?
<ASV> The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because I am marked out by him to give good news to the poor; he has sent me to make well those who are broken-hearted; to say that the prisoners will be let go, and the blind will see, and to make the wounded free from their chains,
<ASV> And because of his love for your fathers, he took their seed and made it his, and he himself, present among you, took you out of Egypt by his great power;
<ASV> For we came into the world with nothing, and we are not able to take anything out;
<ASV> Truly I say to you, You will not come out from there till you have made payment of the very last farthing.
<ASV> And they, by their keeping of the law without circumcision, will be judges of you, by whom the law is broken though you have the letter of the law and circumcision.
<ASV> Now there are different qualities given to men, but the same Spirit.
<ASV> For though there are those who have the name of gods, in heaven or on earth, as there are a number of gods and a number of lords,
<ASV> And you took your robes and made high places for yourself ornamented with every colour, acting like a loose woman on them, without shame or fear.
<ASV> And we went away from Philippi by ship after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at Troas in five days; and we were there for seven days.
<ASV> And when this took place, all the others in the island who had diseases came and were made well.
<ASV> Now after Pharaoh had let the people go, God did not take them through the land of the Philistines, though that was near: for God said, If the people see war, they may have a change of heart and go back to Egypt.
<ASV> And so that no man might be able to say anything against us in the business of this giving which has been put into our hands:
<ASV> Then Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and body-covers which had been King David's and which were kept in the house of God.
<ASV> Because you have said, The two nations and the two countries are to be mine, and we will take them for our heritage; though the Lord was there:
<ASV> His haters will be clothed with shame; but I will make his crown shining.
<ASV> Or if he becomes unclean through touching unconsciously any unclean thing of man, whatever it may be, when it is made clear to him he will be responsible:
<ASV> And it will be after the end of seventy years, that the Lord will have mercy on Tyre, and she will go back to her trade, acting as a loose woman with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.
<ASV> Then the priest will come and see it; and if the disease in the house is increased in size, it is the leper's disease working out in the house: it is unclean.
<ASV> And this is the reason why Joshua did so: all the males of the people who came out of Egypt, all the fighting-men, had been overtaken by death in the waste land on the way, after they came out of Egypt.
<ASV> But if you will not undergo circumcision as we say, then we will take our daughter and go.
<ASV> The delights of your house will be showered on them; you will give them drink from the river of your pleasures.
<ASV> So have no fear, O Jacob, my servant, says the Lord; and do not be troubled, O Israel: for see, I will make you come back from far away, and your seed from the land where they are prisoners; and Jacob will come back, and will be quiet and at peace, and no one will give him cause for fear.
<ASV> And David said to the young man who gave him the news, Why are you certain that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?
<ASV> All the days while it is waste will the land have rest, such rest as it never had in your Sabbaths, when you were living in it.
<ASV> And of Asher, forty thousand who went out with the army, expert in ordering the fight.
<ASV> In order that man may be turned from his evil works, and that pride may be taken away from him;
<ASV> The Lord will go out as a man of war, he will be moved to wrath like a fighting-man: his voice will be strong, he will give a loud cry; he will go against his attackers like a man of war.
<ASV> Is not my word like fire? says the Lord; and like a hammer, smashing the rock to bits?
<ASV> And come and take your place before me in this house, which is named by my name, and say, We have been made safe; so that you may do all these disgusting things?
<ASV> Give attention to the good man, and take note of the upright; because the end of that man is peace.
<ASV> O Lord, take me out of the hands of my haters; my soul is waiting for you.
<ASV> If, when I saw the sun shining, and the moon moving on its bright way,
<ASV> And the priests and the Levites will never be without a man to come before me, offering burned offerings and perfumes and meal offerings and offerings of beasts at all times.
<ASV> And what agreement is there between Christ and the Evil One? or what part has one who has faith with one who has not?
<ASV> For so the Lord has given us orders, saying, I have given you for a light to the Gentiles so that you may be for salvation to the ends of the earth.
<ASV> Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron;
<ASV> Your neck is as a tower of ivory; your eyes like the waters in Heshbon, by the doorway of Bath-rabbim; your nose is as the tower on Lebanon looking over Damascus:
<ASV> But about the dead coming back to life, have you no knowledge of what was said to you by God in the Writings:
<ASV> Let your voice be loud in song, O heavens; and be glad, O earth; make sounds of joy, O mountains, for the Lord has given comfort to his people, and will have mercy on his crushed ones.
<ASV> O Lord, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the deepest thoughts of your people, and let their hearts be fixed and true to you;
<ASV> In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
<ASV> And they said, We will send for the girl, and let her make the decision.
<ASV> Put in writing, then, the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will be after these;
<ASV> Now if we put bits of iron into horses' mouths so that they may be guided by us, we have complete control of their bodies.
<ASV> And in addition you are to give him the first of your grain and wine and oil, and the first wool cut from your sheep.
<ASV> You are not to make an image or picture of anything in heaven or on the earth or in the waters under the earth:
<ASV> So the Lord God sent them away into every part of the earth: and they gave up building their town.
<ASV> For you, O Lord, have given up your people, the family of Jacob, because they are full of the evil ways of the east, and make use of secret arts like the Philistines, and are friends with the children of strange countries.
<ASV> For what is there in which you were made less than the other churches, but in the one thing that I was not a trouble to you? Let me have forgiveness for this wrong.
<ASV> Lod and Ono, the valley of expert workers.
<ASV> Josiah was eight years old when he became king; and he was ruling in Jerusalem for thirty-one years; his mother's name was Jedidah, daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.
<ASV> And the people to whom they are prophets will be pushed out dead into the streets of Jerusalem, because there is no food, and because of the sword; and they will have no one to put their bodies into the earth, them or their wives or their sons or their daughters: for I will let loose their evil-doing on them.
<ASV> And when they had gone past the first and second watchmen they came to the iron door into the town, which came open by itself: and they went out and down one street; and then the angel went away.
<ASV> Give praise to the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, you are very great; you are robed with honour and power.
<ASV> For there are men who are not ruled by law; foolish talkers, false teachers, specially those of the circumcision,
<ASV> And Hezekiah, king of Judah, sent to Lachish, to the king of Assyria, saying, I have done wrong; give up attacking me, and whatever you put on me I will undergo. And the payment he was to make was fixed by the king of Assyria at three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
<ASV> Wisdom and knowledge and wise suggestions are of no use against the Lord.
<ASV> And David got together at Jerusalem all the rulers of Israel, the chiefs of the tribes and the captains of the divisions waiting on the king in turn, and the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds and the controllers of all the goods and property of the king and his sons, with the unsexed servants and the great men of war.
<ASV> She is cruel to her young ones, as if they were not hers; her work is to no purpose; she has no fear.
<ASV> Truly I say to you, When you were young, you made yourself ready and went wherever you had a desire to go: but when you are old, you will put out your hands and another will make you ready, and you will be taken where you have no desire to go.
<ASV> Cursed be Canaan; let him be a servant of servants to his brothers.
<ASV> And Ebed-melech went out from the king's house and said to the king,
<ASV> He whose ways are true, and whose words are upright; he who gives no thought to the profits of false acts, whose hands have not taken rewards, who will have no part in putting men to death, and whose eyes are shut against evil;
<ASV> And Jabez made a prayer to the God of Israel, saying, If only you would truly give me a blessing, and make wider the limits of my land, and let your hand be with me, and keep me from evil, so that I may not be troubled by it! And God gave him his desire.
<ASV> So I have made a start with your punishment; I have made you waste because of your sins.
<ASV> Then Harbonah, one of the unsexed servants waiting before the king, said, See, the pillar fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai, who said a good word for the king, is still in its place in Haman's house. Then the king said, Put him to death by hanging him on it.
<ASV> So that the sons of men may have knowledge of his acts of power, and of the great glory of his kingdom.
<ASV> Be glad in the Lord, O doers of righteousness; for praise is beautiful for the upright.
<ASV> And Isaac answering said, But I have made him your master, and have given him all his brothers for servants; I have made him strong with grain and wine: what then am I to do for you, my son?
<ASV> But he said, Man, who made me a judge or a maker of decisions for you?
<ASV> And his mouth was open to say evil against God, and against his name and his Tent, even against those who are in heaven.
<ASV> The man who is honoured and responsible is the head, and the prophet who gives false teaching is the tail.
<ASV> By their side Meremoth, the son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, was making good the walls. Then Meshullam, the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel; and by him, Zadok, the son of Baana.
<ASV> And if anyone does wrong, and does any of the things which the Lord has given orders are not to be done, though he has no knowledge of it, still he is in the wrong and he is responsible.
<ASV> All the land is in flight because of the noise of the horsemen and the bowmen; they have taken cover in the woodland and up on the rocks: every town has been given up, not a man is living in them.
<ASV> And certain of the priests' sons with wind instruments; Zechariah, the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph,
<ASV> And David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, Come, let us go in flight, or not one of us will be safe from Absalom: let us go without loss of time, or he will overtake us quickly and send evil on us, and put the town to the sword.
<ASV> Who are you, and by what right have you made for yourself a resting-place here?
<ASV> So Joshua and all the men of war with him came against them suddenly at the waters of Merom, and made an attack on them.
<ASV> He was troubled by the archers; they sent out their arrows against him, cruelly wounding him:
<ASV> This is he who came by water and by blood, Jesus Christ; not by water only but by water and by blood.
<ASV> And this is to be the priests' right: those who make an offering of a sheep or an ox are to give to the priest the top part of the leg and the two sides of the head and the stomach.
<ASV> I will make your towns unpeopled and you will be a waste; and you will be certain that I am the Lord.
<ASV> I will give news of the great acts of the Lord God; my words will be of your righteousness, and of yours only.
<ASV> Let your ear now take note and let your eyes be open, so that you may give ear to the prayer of your servant, which I make before you at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel, your servants, while I put before you the sins of the children of Israel, which we have done against you: truly, I and my father's people are sinners.
<ASV> And they went back and got ready spices and perfumes; and on the Sabbath they took their rest, in agreement with the law.
<ASV> Now there were in Samaria seventy of Ahab's sons. And Jehu sent letters to Samaria, to the rulers of the town, and to the responsible men, and to those who had the care of the sons of Ahab, saying,
<ASV> For death has come up into our windows, forcing its way into our great houses; cutting off the children in the streets and the young men in the wide places.
<ASV> And David said to Ittai, Go forward, then. And Ittai the Gittite went on, with all his men and all the little ones he had with him.
<ASV> Now I say this, my brothers, that it is not possible for flesh and blood to have a part in the kingdom of God; and death may not have a part in life.
<ASV> Then when they had taken food, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, is your love for me greater than the love of these others? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you are certain of my love for you. He said to him, Then give my lambs food.
<ASV> And he made the veil of the best linen, blue and purple and red, worked with winged ones designed by expert workmen.
<ASV> For at that time they had no knowledge that the Writings said that he would have to come again from the dead.
<ASV> And if the Lord your God makes wide the limits of your land, as he said in his oath to your fathers, and gives you all the land which he undertook to give to your fathers;
<ASV> Because Ephraim has been increasing altars for sin, altars have become a cause of sin to him.
<ASV> But Rehoboam was still king over those of the children of Israel who were living in the towns of Judah.
<ASV> He gives food to every beast, and to the young ravens in answer to their cry.
<ASV> He said to Judah, Let us make these towns, building walls round them with towers and doors and locks. The land is still ours, because we have been true to the Lord our God; we have been true to him and he has given us rest on every side. So they went on building and all went well for them.
<ASV> Give ear to my cry, for I am made very low: take me out of the hands of my haters, for they are stronger than I.
<ASV> If your law had not been my delight, my troubles would have put an end to me.
<ASV> Because we have knowledge that some who went from us have been troubling you with their words, putting your souls in doubt; to whom we gave no such order;
<ASV> At my first meeting with my judges, no one took my part, but all went away from me. May it not be put to their account.
<ASV> And Eliphaz the Temanite made answer and said,
<ASV> ...
<ASV> And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves hated by David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver as payment for war-carriages and horsemen from Mesopotamia and Aram-maacah and Zobah.

<ASV> And Jehoshaphat was living in Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people, from Beer-sheba to the hill-country of Ephraim, guiding them back to the Lord, the God of their fathers.
<ASV> Now there was in the town a poor, wise man, and he, by his wisdom, kept the town safe. But no one had any memory of that same poor man.
<ASV> But put him to death without question; let your hand be the first stretched out against him to put him to death, and then the hands of all the people.
<ASV> Then Joseph said, These two dreams have the same sense: God has made clear to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
<ASV> Nothing is to be done to the virgin, because there is no cause of death in her: it is the same as if a man made an attack on his neighbour and put him to death:
<ASV> And Elisha said to them, This is not the way, and this is not the town: come after me so that I may take you to the man you are searching for. And he took them to Samaria.
<ASV> And more than this, you have not taken us into a land flowing with milk and honey, or given us a heritage of fields and vine-gardens: will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up.
<ASV> And after saying all this to the people,
<ASV> Why then did you not put my money in a bank, so that when I came I would get it back with interest?
<ASV> The deep places of the earth are in his hand; and the tops of the mountains are his.
<ASV> Then Moses said to Aaron, This is what the Lord said, I will be holy in the eyes of all those who come near to me, and I will be honoured before all the people. And Aaron said nothing.
<ASV> For unnumbered evils are round about me; my sins have overtaken me, so that I am bent down with their weight; they are more than the hairs of my head, my strength is gone because of them.
<ASV> But to the rest I say, and not the Lord; If a brother has a wife who is not a Christian, and it is her desire to go on living with him, let him not go away from her.
<ASV> No leaven is to be offered with the blood of my offering, and the offering of the Passover feast may not be kept till the morning.
<ASV> And I will send you away from before my face, as I have sent away all your brothers, even all the seed of Ephraim.
<ASV> For Moses says that the man who does the righteousness which is of the law will get life by it.
<ASV> But now, get me a player of music, and it will come about that while the man is playing, the hand of the Lord will come on me and I will give you the word of the Lord: and they got a player of music, and while the man was playing, the hand of the Lord was on him.
<ASV> After this, Jesus went from place to place in Galilee. He did not go about in Judaea, because the Jews were looking for a chance to put him to death.
<ASV> Because everything which God has made is good, and nothing is evil, if it is taken with praise:
<ASV> Go far away from her, do not come near the door of her house;
<ASV> He gave it to Joseph as a witness, when he went out over the land of Egypt; then the words of a strange tongue were sounding in my ears.
<ASV> He has kept his agreement in mind for ever, the word which he gave for a thousand generations;
<ASV> All these men of war, expert in ordering the fight, came to Hebron with the full purpose of making David king over all Israel; and all the rest of Israel were united in their desire to make David king.
<ASV> And a voice came to him, saying, Come, Peter; take them for food.
<ASV> O you, who are full of false tricks and evil ways, a son of the Evil One, hating all righteousness, will you for ever be turning people from the right ways of the Lord?
<ASV> From Judah, Nahshon, the son of Amminadab;
<ASV> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
<ASV> You are to have the same law for a man of another nation living among you as for an Israelite; for I am the Lord your God.
<ASV> See, I am sending you Elijah the prophet before the day of the Lord comes, that great day, greatly to be feared.
<ASV> Then his purpose will be changed, over-stepping the limit; he will make his strength his god.
<ASV> So this is what the Lord has said: I have come back to Jerusalem with mercies; my house is to be put up in her, says the Lord of armies, and a line is to be stretched out over Jerusalem.
<ASV> But he said, More happy are they who give hearing to the word of God and keep it.
<ASV> Lifting up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,
<ASV> And you are to be holy to me; for I the Lord am holy and have made you separate from the nations, so that you may be my people.
<ASV> Take care that your hearts are not lifted up in pride, giving no thought to the Lord your God who took you out of the land of Egypt, out of the prison-house;
<ASV> O Lord, my cry goes up to you: for fire has put an end to the grass-lands of the waste, and all the trees of the field are burned with its flame.
<ASV> And news of the coming of the children of Israel came to the king of Arad, the Canaanite, who was living in the South in the land of Canaan.
<ASV> Let us now put him to death and put his body into one of these holes, and we will say, An evil beast has put him to death: then we will see what becomes of his dreams.
<ASV> Then the iron and the earth, the brass and the silver and the gold, were smashed together, and became like the dust on the floors where grain is crushed in summer; and the wind took them away so that no sign of them was to be seen: and the stone which gave the image a blow became a great mountain, covering all the earth.
<ASV> Take care to do the orders which I give you today; I will send out from before you the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite.
<ASV> Because God has put it in their hearts to do his purpose, and to be of one mind, giving their kingdom to the beast, till the words of God have effect and are complete.
<ASV> I the Lord have said it, and this I will certainly do to all this evil people who have come together against me: in this waste land destruction will come on them, and death will be their fate.
<ASV> And while their faces were bent down to the earth in fear, these said to them, Why are you looking for the living among the dead?
<ASV> I come quickly: keep that which you have, so that no one may take your crown.
<ASV> And it will be turned to a witness for you.
<ASV> So that you may not take them as your example and do all the disgusting things which they do in the worship of their gods, so sinning against the Lord your God.
<ASV> For we are conscious that all living things are weeping and sorrowing in pain together till now.
<ASV> No doubt the story has come to your ears of what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, putting them to the curse: and will you be kept safe from their fate?
<ASV> Whose tongue is not false, who does no evil to his friend, and does not take away the good name of his neighbour;
<ASV> In answer, Jesus said, Is there not a saying in your law, I said, You are gods?
<ASV> And there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle, so that she might go in flight into the waste land, to her place, where she is given food for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the snake.
<ASV> Then, opening his mouth, and cursing the day of his birth,
<ASV> Happy is the man in whom is the fear of the Lord at all times; but he whose heart is hard will come into trouble.
<ASV> And I put a ring in your nose and ear-rings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.
<ASV> And her sister Oholibah saw this, but her desire was even more unmeasured, and her loose behaviour was worse than that of her sister.
<ASV> For the Lord your God will give you his blessing as he has said: you will let other nations have the use of your money, but you will not make use of theirs; you will be rulers over a number of nations, but they will not be your rulers.
<ASV> The son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,
<ASV> And I saw the holy town, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, like a bride made beautiful for her husband.
<ASV> For we have had news of how the Lord made the Red Sea dry before you when you came out of Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, on the other side of Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you gave up to the curse.
<ASV> Give honour to your father and to your mother, so that your life may be long in the land which the Lord your God is giving you.
<ASV> And Shitrai the Sharonite was responsible for the herds in the grass-lands of Sharon, and Shaphat, the son of Adlai, for those in the valleys;
<ASV> And Moses took his wife and his sons and put them on an ass and went back to the land of Egypt: and he took the rod of God in his hand.
<ASV> And the Lord said to me, There is an evil design at work among the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem.
<ASV> And he gave orders to Gehazi, and said, Send for the Shunammite. And she came in answer to his voice. And he said, Take up your son.
<ASV> Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre, This is what the Lord has said: Because your heart has been lifted up, and you have said, I am a god, I am seated on the seat of God in the heart of the seas; but you are man and not God, though you have made your heart as the heart of God:
<ASV> A servant when he becomes a king; a man without sense when his wealth is increased;
<ASV> And Abijah went out to the fight with an army of men of war, four hundred thousand of his best men; and Jeroboam put his forces in line against him, eight hundred thousand of his best men of war.
<ASV> In whose hand is the instrument with which he will make clean his grain; he will put the good grain in his store, but the waste will be burned up in the fire which will never be put out.
<ASV> O house of Aaron, have faith in the Lord: he is their help and their breastplate.
<ASV> The Lord your God who goes before you will be fighting for you, and will do such wonders as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;
<ASV> And then the Lord said to me, I have seen that this people is stiff-necked:
<ASV> And you will be named happy by all nations: for you will be a land of delight, says the Lord of armies.
<ASV> For he came across her in the open country, and there was no one to come to the help of the virgin in answer to her cry.
<ASV> For the Lord has taken Jacob for himself, and Israel for his property.
<ASV> And he gave orders for the carriage to be stopped, and the two of them went down into the water, and Philip gave him baptism.
<ASV> And Moses said to the Lord, The people will not be able to come up the mountain, for you gave us orders to put limits round the mountain, marking it out and making it holy.
<ASV> They have to get a resting-place in the hollows of the valleys, in holes of the earth and rocks.
<ASV> Have no fear, O land; be glad with great joy; for the Lord has done great things.
<ASV> And when Abner was back in Hebron, Joab took him on one side by the doorway of the town to have a word with him quietly, and there he gave him a wound in the stomach, causing his death in payment for the death of his brother Asahel.

<ASV> &lt;To the chief music-maker; put to Shushan-eduth. Michtam. Of David. For teaching. When he was fighting against Aram-naharaim and Aramzobah, when Joab came back, and put twelve thousand of the Edomites to death, in the Valley of Salt.&gt; God, you have put us away from you, you have sent us in all directions, you have been angry; O be turned to us again.

<ASV> Death will give them their food like sheep; the underworld is their fate and they will go down into it; their flesh is food for worms; their form is wasted away; the underworld is their resting-place for ever.
<ASV> Because your ears were shut to my voice; no one gave attention to my out-stretched hand;
<ASV> But now, O Lord our God, give us salvation from his hand, so that it may be clear to all the kingdoms of the earth that you, and you only, are the Lord.
<ASV> And in the evening let them come back, and make a noise like a dog, and go round the town.

<ASV> And these are the outskirts of the town: on the north side, four thousand five hundred by measure;
<ASV> But so that things may be equal; that from those things of which you have more than enough at the present time their need may be helped, and that if you are in any need they may be a help to you in the same way, making things equal.
<ASV> And so I came without question, when I was sent for. What then is your purpose in sending for me?
<ASV> And he said, Take these seven lambs from me as a witness that I have made this water-hole.
<ASV> My servant Moses is not so; he is true to me in all my house:
<ASV> The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Temah,
<ASV> Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give your opinion now, what are we to do?

<ASV> Then he said to the near relation, Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, is offering for a price that bit of land which was our brother Elimelech's:

<ASV> Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and the good he did, are recorded in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
<ASV> Before you were formed in the body of your mother I had knowledge of you, and before your birth I made you holy; I have given you the work of being a prophet to the nations.
<ASV> And give worship to the Lord your God, who will send his blessing on your bread and on your water; and I will take all disease away from among you.

<ASV> And carriages went up with him and horsemen, a great army.
<ASV> In that day there will be an altar to the Lord in the middle of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the Lord at the edge of the land.
<ASV> But his father would not, saying, I am doing it on purpose, my son; he will certainly become a nation and a great one; but his younger brother will be greater than he, and his seed will become a great family of nations.
<ASV> Then a winged one came to me with a burning coal in his hand, which he had taken from off the altar with the fire-spoon.

<ASV> My wounds are poisoned and evil-smelling, because of my foolish behaviour.
<ASV> And they said, We came to the land where you sent us, and truly it is flowing with milk and honey: and here is some of the produce of it.
<ASV> And I will put my holy House among you, and my soul will not be turned away from you in disgust.
<ASV> I said in my heart, The Lord will not give ear to me:

<ASV> I will make your seed like the stars of heaven in number, and will give them all these lands, and your seed will be a blessing to all the nations of the earth;

<ASV> And let limits be marked out for the people round the mountain, and say to them, Take care not to go up the mountain or near the sides of it: whoever puts his foot on the mountain will certainly come to his death:

<ASV> For he who is strong has done great things for me; and holy is his name.
<ASV> Say to the children of Israel: He who makes a peace-offering to the Lord, is to give an offering to the Lord out of his peace-offering:

<ASV> But do not take the measure of the space outside the house; because it has been given to the nations: and the holy town will be under their feet for forty-two months.

<ASV> For he does not give man a fixed time to come before him to be judged.
<ASV> Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his power, and how he made the pool and the stream, to take water into the town, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Judah?
<ASV> Whom I will see on my side, and not as one strange to me. My heart is broken with desire.
<ASV> Then Esther said in answer, My prayer and my request is this:

<ASV> But put now a question to the beasts, and get teaching from them; or to the birds of the heaven, and they will make it clear to you;
<ASV> And David said, Is there still anyone of Saul's family living, so that I may be a friend to him, because of Jonathan?
<ASV> For if God did not have pity for the angels who did evil, but sent them down into hell, to be kept in chains of eternal night till they were judged;
<ASV> This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said to all those whom I have taken away prisoners from Jerusalem to Babylon:
<ASV> For the Lord has made you come back to him, like a wife who has been sent away in grief of spirit; for one may not give up the wife of one's early days.
<ASV> Truly men of low birth are nothing, and men of high position are not what they seem; if they are put in the scales together they are less than a breath.

<ASV> Come back, come back, O Shulammite; come back, come back, so that our eyes may see you. What will you see in the Shulammite? A sword-dance.
<ASV> And if he does not get it back by the end of the year, then the house in the town will become the property of him who gave the money for it, and of his children for ever; it will not go from him in the year of Jubilee.

<ASV> See, I am sending my servant, and he will make ready the way before me; and the Lord, whom you are looking for, will suddenly come to his Temple; and the angel of the agreement, in whom you have delight, see, he is coming, says the Lord of armies.

<ASV> Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all he did, are they not recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel?
<ASV> The Lord has made ready his high seat in the heavens; his kingdom is ruling over all.
<ASV> He makes little of kings, rulers are a sport to him; all the strong places are to be laughed at; for he makes earthworks and takes them.

<ASV> And a great sign was seen in heaven: a A woman clothed with the sun, and with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.
<ASV> And suddenly the Lord said to Moses and Aaron and Miriam, Come out, you three, to the Tent of meeting. And the three of them went out.
<ASV> Now Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces which were in the field, came to Gedaliah in Mizpah,

<ASV> Let it come about that, while I am waiting here by the water-spring, if a girl comes to get water and I say to her, Give me a little water from your vessel, and she says,
<ASV> I give you orders, before God and Christ Jesus, who will be the judge of the living and the dead, and by his revelation and his kingdom;

<ASV> And Aaron took the breasts and the right leg, waving them for a wave offering before the Lord, as Moses gave orders.
<ASV> Even so the tongue is a small part of the body, but it takes credit for great things. How much wood may be lighted by a very little fire!
<ASV> For this cause I have said, Let your eyes be turned away from me in my bitter weeping; I will not be comforted for the wasting of the daughter of my people.
<ASV> And he was in need of food: but while they were getting it ready, a deep sleep came on him;
<ASV> But every man's servant, whom he has got for money, may take of it, when he has had circumcision.
<ASV> And now I am conscious that you, among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom, will not see my face again.
<ASV> After they had gone three or four miles they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near to the boat; and they had great fear.
<ASV> And he said, Father, it is my request that you will send him to my father's house;
<ASV> He who has ears, let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give of the secret manna, and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name, of which no one has knowledge but he to whom it is given.
<ASV> Nun his son, Joshua his son.

<ASV> But if he had no evil purpose against him, and God gave him into his hand, I will give you a place to which he may go in flight.
<ASV> And he took me to the door of the open place; and looking, I saw a hole in the wall.
<ASV> Then sending for Peter and John, they said, By what power and in whose name have you done this?

<ASV> But the word of the Lord is eternal. And this is the word of the good news which was given to you.
<ASV> Give ear to the words of this agreement, and say to the men of Judah and to the people of Jerusalem,

<ASV> And there was great weeping in all the country when all the people went through; and the king himself was waiting in the Kidron valley and all the people went by him in the direction of the olive-tree on the edge of the waste land.
<ASV> And when our haters had news of this, all the nations round about us were full of fear and were greatly shamed, for they saw that this work had been done by our God.
<ASV> For this was the reason why the good news of Jesus was given even to the dead, so that they might be judged as men in the flesh, but might be living before God in the spirit.
<ASV> Amaziah, the son of Joash, king of Judah, went on living for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash, son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.

<ASV> For this cause you will see no more foolish visions or make false use of secret arts: and I will make my people free from your power; and you will be certain that I am the Lord.
<ASV> This is the law when death comes to a man in his tent: everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, will be unclean for seven days.
<ASV> And in the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
<ASV> The land was dark with the wrath of the Lord of armies: the people were like those who take men's flesh for food.
<ASV> Jesus said, My food is to do the pleasure of him who sent me and to make his work complete.

<ASV> Sorrow is mine, my mother, because you have given birth to me, a cause of fighting and argument in all the earth! I have not made men my creditors and I am not in debt to any, but every one of them is cursing me.
<ASV> This sin will be to you like a crack in a high wall, causing its fall suddenly and in a minute.

<ASV> Say to the children of Israel, If a woman is with child and gives birth to a male child, she will be unclean for seven days, as when she is unwell.
<ASV> I will go before you, and make the rough places level: the doors of brass will be broken, and the iron rods cut in two:
<ASV> But who am I and what is my people, that we have power to give so freely in this way? for all things come from you, and what we have given you is yours.

<ASV> I keep watch like a bird by itself on the house-top.
<ASV> So Moses and Aaron and the chiefs of the people took in hand the numbering of the sons of the Kohathites, by families, in the order of their fathers' houses;

<ASV> &lt;Shiggaion of David; a song which he made to the Lord, about the words of Cush the Benjamite.&gt; O Lord my God, I put my faith in you; take me out of the hands of him who is cruel to me, and make me free;
<ASV> Job's words do not come from knowledge; they are not the fruit of wisdom.
<ASV> For this cause I will be your judge, O children of Israel, judging every man by his ways, says the Lord. Come back and be turned from all your sins; so that they may not be the cause of your falling into evil.
<ASV> The people said in answer, You have an evil spirit: who has any desire to put you to death?
<ASV> Jesus then said to them, Truly I say to you, What Moses gave you was not the bread from heaven; it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.
<ASV> See if there is any way of sorrow in me, and be my guide in the eternal way.
<ASV> Then Joshua put up an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, in Mount Ebal,

<ASV> I will say to God, Do not put me down as a sinner; make clear to me what you have against me.
<ASV> For their rock is not like our Rock, even our haters themselves being judges.
<ASV> So every one of us will have to give an account of himself to God.
<ASV> ...
<ASV> And there will no longer be a plant with sharp points wounding the children of Israel, or a thorn troubling them among any who are round about them, who put shame on them; and they will be certain that I am the Lord.
<ASV> And God, looking on the light, saw that it was good: and God made a division between the light and the dark,

<ASV> The eyes of all men are waiting for you; and you give them their food in its time.

<ASV> These you may have for food of all things living in the water: anything living in the water, in the seas or rivers, which has special parts for swimming and skin formed of thin plates, may be used for food.
<ASV> Let your hair be cut off, O Jerusalem, and let it go, and let a song of grief go up on the open hilltops; for the Lord is turned away from the generation of his wrath and has given them up.
<ASV> So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. Then let not that which has been joined by God be parted by man.
<ASV> But I will not take away my mercy from him, and will not be false to my faith.

<ASV> And hearing it he went running out without his coat.
<ASV> But Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, gave Jeremiah his help, so that he was not given into the hands of the people to be put to death.
<ASV> And he said to his daughters, Where is he? why have you let the man go? make him come in and give him a meal.

<ASV> Under the edge on the two opposite sides, you are to make two gold rings, to take the rods for lifting it.
<ASV> For rulers are not a cause of fear to the good work but to the evil. If you would have no fear of the authority, do good and you will have praise;

<ASV> He had the altars of the Baals broken down, while he himself was present; and the sun-images which were placed on high over them he had cut down; and the pillars of wood and the metal images he had broken up and crushed to dust, dropping the dust over the resting-places of the dead who had made offerings to them.
<ASV> And if the daughter of a priest is married to an outside person she may not take of the holy things which are lifted up as offerings.
<ASV> These are the words of the Lord of armies, the God of Israel: Put your burned offerings with your offerings of beasts, and take flesh for your food.
<ASV> Then it became clear to me that it was a question of their law, and that nothing was said against him which might be a reason for prison or death.
<ASV> And keep in mind the way by which the Lord your God has taken you through the waste land these forty years, so that he might make low your pride and put you to the test, to see what was in your heart and if you would keep his orders or not.

<ASV> Giving to the needs of the saints, ready to take people into your houses.
<ASV> The young man says to him, All these things have I done: what more is there?
<ASV> And a separate tenth part for every one of the seven lambs;
<ASV> In the thirty-sixth year of the rule of Asa, Baasha, king of Israel, went up against Judah, building Ramah so that no one was able to go out or in to Asa, king of Judah.
<ASV> O Lord, you have knowledge: keep me in mind and come to my help, and give their right reward to those who are attacking me; take me not away, for you are slow to be angry: see how I have undergone shame because of you from all those who make little of your word;
<ASV> He is pulling it out, and it comes out of his back; and its shining point comes out of his side; he is overcome by fears.
<ASV> Now, if their fall is the wealth of the world, and their loss the wealth of the Gentiles, how much greater will be the glory when they are made full?

<ASV> If death comes suddenly through disease, he makes sport of the fate of those who have done no wrong.
<ASV> When the storm-wind is past, the sinner is seen no longer, but the upright man is safe for ever.
<ASV> Give ear to the voice of my grief; I have no comforter; all my haters have news of my troubles, they are glad because you have done it: let the day of fate come when they will be like me.
<ASV> So take care not to be troubled before the time comes, about what answers you will give:
<ASV> Let those who have been forced out of Moab have a resting-place with you; be a cover to them from him who is making waste their land: till the cruel ones are cut off, and wasting has come to an end, and those who take pleasure in crushing the poor are gone from the land.
<ASV> And when they were taking food, Jesus took bread and, after blessing it, he gave the broken bread to the disciples and said, Take it; this is my body.
<ASV> Then keep the orders of the Lord your God, fearing him and walking in his ways.
<ASV> And of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, a chief, Elizaphan, the son of Parnach.
<ASV> For John the Baptist came, taking no food or drink, and you say, He has an evil spirit.
<ASV> Do not be hard on the widow, or the child without a father, on the man from a strange country, or on the poor; let there be no evil thought in your heart against your brother.

<ASV> And no longer will they be teaching every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying, Get knowledge of the Lord: for they will all have knowledge of me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says the Lord: for they will have my forgiveness for their evil-doing, and their sin will go from my memory for ever.
<ASV> You were so beautiful that the story of you went out into all nations; you were completely beautiful because of my glory which I had put on you, says the Lord.
<ASV> With their forty silver bases, two under every board.
<ASV> And after looking at the diseased place, if it does not seem to go deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest will have him shut up for seven days:

<ASV> For this is what the Lord has said: All the land will become a waste; I will make destruction complete.

<ASV> And let the years be numbered from the time when he gave himself to his owner till the year of Jubilee, and the price given for him will be in relation to the number of years, on the scale of the payment of a servant.
<ASV> And in the six hundred and first year, on the first day of the first month, the waters were dry on the earth: and Noah took the cover off the ark and saw that the face of the earth was dry.
<ASV> But a mist went up from the earth, watering all the face of the land.
<ASV> Your fate will be the sword, and you will all go down to death: because when my voice came to you, you made no answer; you did not give ear to my word; but you did what was evil in my eyes, desiring what was not pleasing to me.

<ASV> And Canaan was the father of Zidon, who was his oldest son, and Heth,
<ASV> May the salvation of Israel come out of Zion! When the fate of his people is changed by God, Jacob will have joy, and Israel will be glad.

<ASV> And the Lord sent disease on the king and he became a leper, and to the day of his death he was living separately in his private house. And Jotham his son was over his house, judging the people of the land.
<ASV> The law of the Lord is good, giving new life to the soul: the witness of the Lord is certain, giving wisdom to the foolish.
<ASV> Teaching them to keep all the rules which I have given you: and see, I am ever with you, even to the end of the world.
<ASV> And you saw the trouble of our fathers in Egypt, and their cry came to your ears by the Red Sea;

<ASV> Before her pains came, she gave birth; before her pains, she gave birth to a man-child.
<ASV> Why then have you had no respect for the word of the Lord, doing what is evil in his eyes? You have put Uriah the Hittite to death with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife; you have put him to death with the sword of the children of Ammon.
<ASV> And have no fear of those who put to death the body, but are not able to put to death the soul. But have fear of him who has power to give soul and body to destruction in hell.
<ASV> When all Israel has come before the Lord your God in the place named by him, let a reading be given of this law in the hearing of all Israel.

<ASV> Let the fire be kept burning on the altar at all times; it is never to go out.
<ASV> Have you knowledge of the laws of the heavens? did you give them rule over the earth?
<ASV> I had much to say to you, but it is not my purpose to put it all down with ink and pen:
<ASV> And a number of false prophets will come, causing error.
<ASV> The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
<ASV> His bright flames give light to the world; the earth saw it with fear.
<ASV> You, who are full of loud voices, a town of outcries, given up to joy; your dead men have not been put to the sword, or come to their death in war.
<ASV> But clothed with good works, as is right for women who are living in the fear of God.
<ASV> And they said to one another, Let us make a captain over us, and go back to Egypt.
<ASV> And after the birth of Reu, Peleg went on living for two hundred and nine years, and had sons and daughters:
<ASV> Not in the passion of evil desires, like the Gentiles, who have no knowledge of God;
<ASV> Then said I, O Lord God! see, I have no power of words, for I am a child.
<ASV> So that your faith might be based not on man's wisdom but on the power of God.
<ASV> And Paul, looking fixedly at the Sanhedrin, said, My brothers, my life has been upright before God till this day.
<ASV> Abiezer the Anathothite, Sibbecai the Hushathite,
<ASV> Wisdom is outside the power of the foolish: he keeps his mouth shut in the public place.
<ASV> Be not tricked; God is not made sport of: for whatever seed a man puts in, that will he get back as grain.
<ASV> But they gave no attention, but went on in their old way.
<ASV> &lt;KOPH&gt; I have made my prayer with all my heart; give answer to me, O Lord: I will keep your rules.
<ASV> There was not a man in Ai and Beth-el who did not go out after Israel; and the town was open and unwatched while they went after Israel.
<ASV> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
<ASV> Send one of your number to get your brother, and the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are true; if not, by the life of Pharaoh, your purpose is certainly secret.
<ASV> And not only so, but we have joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we are now at peace with God.
<ASV> In what secret place may a man take cover without my seeing him? says the Lord. Is there any place in heaven or earth where I am not? says the Lord.
<ASV> Said in a loud voice, Get up on your feet. And, jumping up, he went walking about.
<ASV> He will keep their souls free from evil designs and violent attacks; and their blood will be of value in his eyes.
<ASV> You give no answer to my cry, and take no note of my prayer.
<ASV> Now after this there was war with the Philistines at Gezer; then Sibbecai the Hushathite put to death Sippai, one of the offspring of the Rephaim; and they were overcome.
<ASV> And the Apostles and the rulers of the church came together and gave thought to the question.

<ASV> Now Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, gave orders about Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, saying,
<ASV> Your bow was quite uncovered. Selah. By you the earth was cut through with rivers.

<ASV> And the angel of the Lord made a statement to Joshua, and said,
<ASV> And Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, went out and came to the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day, when he was resting in the middle of the day. Now the woman who kept the door was cleaning grain, and sleep overcame her.
<ASV> Not because we have not the right, but to make ourselves an example to you, so that you might do the same.
<ASV> And be like men who are looking for their lord, when he comes back from the bride-feast; so that when he comes to the door, it will be open to him quickly.

<ASV> My voice went up to you, O Lord; I made my prayer to the Lord.
<ASV> For her house is on the way down to death; her footsteps go down to the shades:
<ASV> If, then, Demetrius and the workmen who are with him have a protest to make against any man, the law is open to them, and there are judges; let them put up a cause at law against one another.
<ASV> The man of wealth seems to himself to be wise, but the poor man who has sense has a low opinion of him.

<ASV> And the Lord said to Aaron, Go into the waste land and you will see Moses. So he went and came across Moses at the mountain of God, and gave him a kiss.

<ASV> And I saw another angel in flight between heaven and earth, having eternal good news to give to those who are on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and language and people,

<ASV> What is the cause of wars and fighting among you? is it not in your desires which are at war in your bodies?

<ASV> What credit is it if, when you have done evil, you take your punishment quietly? but if you are given punishment for doing right, and take it quietly, this is pleasing to God.
<ASV> Even if these three men were in it, by my life, says the Lord, they would not keep safe their sons or daughters, but only themselves, and the land would be made waste.
<ASV> So that no flesh might have glory before God.
<ASV> So the Lord sent disease on Israel, causing the death of seventy thousand men.
<ASV> See, I am sending an angel before you, to keep you on your way and to be your guide into the place which I have made ready for you.
<ASV> And if a man's hair has come out and he has no hair, still he is clean.
<ASV> And the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem you have given for a price to the sons of the Greeks, to send them far away from their land:
<ASV> But Abimelech said, I have no idea who has done this thing; you never gave me word of it, and I had no knowledge of it till this day.
<ASV> At the same time my reason came back to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my honour and my great name came back to me; and my wise men and my lords were turned to me again; and I was made safe in my kingdom and had more power than before.
<ASV> Then my wrath will be burning against you, and I will give you punishment, I myself, seven times for your sins.
<ASV> But the herdmen of Gerar had a fight with Isaac's herdmen, for they said, The spring is ours: so he gave the spring the name of Esek, because there was a fight about it.
<ASV> Will the ox of the mountains be your servant? or is his night's resting-place by your food-store?
<ASV> There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of your father, light and reason like the wisdom of the gods were seen in him: and King Nebuchadnezzar, your father, made him master of the wonder-workers, and the users of secret arts, and the Chaldaeans, and the readers of signs;
<ASV> Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,
<ASV> And they were bitter against him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is nowhere without honour but in his country and among his family.
<ASV> And the west side will be the Great Sea, from the limit on the south to a point opposite the way into Hamath. This is the west side.
<ASV> And this is what they are to give; let every man who is numbered give half a shekel, by the scale of the holy place: (the shekel being valued at twenty gerahs:) this money is an offering to the Lord.
<ASV> And of Baalath, and all the store-towns which Solomon had, and the towns where he kept his war-carriages and his horse men, and everything which it was his pleasure to put up in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land under his rule.
<ASV> And as for the rest of the tribes: from the east side to the west side: Benjamin, one part.
<ASV> For go over to the sea-lands of Kittim and see; send to Kedar and give deep thought to it; and see if there has ever been such a thing.
<ASV> And he said, These are the two sons of oil, whose place is by the Lord of all the earth.
<ASV> And he said, Hearing your voice in the garden I was full of fear, because I was without clothing: and I kept myself from your eyes.
<ASV> And in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord; for your angry words against the Lord have come to his ears: and what are we that you are crying out against us?
<ASV> And the Lord said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Let your rod be stretched out over the dust of the earth so that it may become insects through all the land of Egypt.
<ASV> Then Zophar the Naamathite made answer and said,
<ASV> But the heart of the people was not turned to him who sent punishment on them, and they made no prayer to the Lord of armies.
<ASV> Then Joseph came to his end, and all his brothers, and all that generation.
<ASV> Then the word of Eliezer the prophet, the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah, came against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because you have let yourself be joined with Ahaziah, the Lord has sent destruction on your works. And the ships were broken and were not able to go to Tarshish.
<ASV> Which at the right time he will make clear, who is the eternal and only Ruler, King of kings, and Lord of lords;
<ASV> They did not have to give any account of the money which was handed to them, for they made use of it with good faith.
<ASV> All the day he is ready to have mercy and to give; his children are a blessing.
<ASV> He put to death the first child of every family in the land, the first-fruits of their strength.
<ASV> Out of your Temple in Jerusalem.
<ASV> In his strength he goes out against the arms of war, turning not away from the sword.
<ASV> Then he made the open space for the priests, and the great open space and its doors, plating the doors with brass.
<ASV> The mountains were covered with its shade, and the great trees with its branches.
<ASV> For the Lord says, As for the unsexed who keep my Sabbaths, and give their hearts to pleasing me, and keep their agreement with me:
<ASV> And not to the Lord: for this reason, he put him to death and gave the kingdom to David, the son of Jesse.
<ASV> Then she became with child again, and gave birth to a son; and said, Because it has come to the Lord's ears that I am not loved, he has given me this son in addition: and she gave him the name Simeon.
<ASV> An upright man goes on in his righteousness: happy are his children after him!
<ASV> And put the oil on Aaron and his sons, making them holy to do the work of priests to me.
<ASV> Because they did not go after him, and took no note of his ways,
<ASV> Now when Joseph saw that his father had put his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it did not seem right to him; and lifting his father's hand he would have put it on the head of Manasseh.
<ASV> May there be knowledge of your wonders in the dark? or of your righteousness where memory is dead?
<ASV> And I will be present among you and will be your God and you will be my people.
<ASV> Jesus said in answer, Even if I give witness about myself, my witness is true, because I have knowledge of where I came from and where I am going; but you have no knowledge of where I come from or of where I am going.
<ASV> All the rivers go down to the sea, but the sea is not full; to the place where the rivers go, there they go again.
<ASV> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
<ASV> For he, and his sons after him for ever, have been marked out by the Lord your God from all your tribes, to do the work of priests in the name of the Lord.
<ASV> And the rod of that man who is marked out by me for myself will have buds on it; so I will put a stop to the outcries which the children of Israel make to me against you.
<ASV> The twenty-first Jachin, the twenty-second Gamul,
<ASV> And the covered way in front of the house was twenty cubits long, as wide as the house, and a hundred and twenty cubits high, all plated inside with the best gold.
<ASV> But crying out they said, To the cross with him!
<ASV> For wrath is the cause of death to the foolish, and he who has no wisdom comes to his end through passion.
<ASV> But on the day after, all the children of Israel made an outcry against Moses and against Aaron, saying, You have put to death the Lord's people.
<ASV> Now then, take note; for the Lord has made selection of you to be the builder of a house for the holy place. Be strong and do it.
<ASV> Let us make search and put our ways to the test, turning again to the Lord;
<ASV> To have respect for the person of the evil-doer is not good, or to give a wrong decision against the upright.
<ASV> To him who took his people through the waste land: for his mercy is unchanging for ever.
<ASV> And the name of the second river is Gihon: this river goes round all the land of Cush.
<ASV> And I will take you into the waste land of the peoples, and there I will take up the cause with you face to face.
<ASV> O Israel, have faith in the Lord: he is their help and their breastplate.
<ASV> Have mercy on me, O Lord; for my cry goes up to you all the day.
<ASV> And the Lord said, Am I to keep back from Abraham the knowledge of what I do;
<ASV> Saying, Friends, I see that this journey will be one of great damage and loss, not only to the goods and the ship, but to ourselves.
<ASV> And Moses said to Korah, You and all your band are to come before the Lord tomorrow, you and they and Aaron:
<ASV> For this is what the Lord has said: I will do to you as you have done, you who, putting the oath on one side, have let the agreement be broken.
<ASV> This again I have seen under the sun as wisdom and it seemed great to me.
<ASV> See, we have made search with care, and it is so; it has come to our ears; see that you take note of it for yourself.
<ASV> They have all gone out of the way together; they are unclean, there is not one who does good, no, not one.
<ASV> And they had no answer to that question.
<ASV> You may not have sex connection with your mother's sister, for she is your mother's near relation.
<ASV> Teaching them to your children with all care, talking of them when you are at rest in your house or walking by the way, when you go to sleep and when you get up.
<ASV> And let them all be burned on the altar as a burned offering to the Lord: a sweet smell, an offering made by fire to the Lord.
<ASV> And I made answer and said to the angel who was talking to me, What are these, my lord?
<ASV> And after hearing the king, they went on their way; and the star which they saw in the east went before them, till it came to rest over the place where the young child was.
<ASV> When Jesus had said these words he went out with his disciples over the stream Kedron to a garden, into which he went with his disciples.
<ASV> And crying out against God and against Moses, they said, Why have you taken us out of Egypt to come to our death in the waste land? For there is no bread and no water, and this poor bread is disgusting to us.
<ASV> Am I not free? am I not an Apostle? have I not seen Jesus our Lord? are you not my work in the Lord?
<ASV> Now for a long time Israel has been without the true God, and without a teaching priest and without the law;
<ASV> And the sons of Caleb, the son of Jephunneh: Iru, Elah, and Naam; and the son of Elah: Kenaz.
<ASV> For there is one God and one peacemaker between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
<ASV> The Lord said to my Lord, Be seated at my right hand, till I put under your feet all those who are against you?
<ASV> And someone came and said to them, The men, whom you put in prison, are in the Temple teaching the people.
<ASV> And it will be on that day that a great fear will be sent among them from the Lord; and everyone will take his neighbour's hand, and every man's hand will be lifted against his neighbour's.
<ASV> For the holy bread, and for the regular meal offering and the regular burned offering on the Sabbaths and at the new moon and the fixed feasts, and for the sin-offerings to take away the sin of Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God.
<ASV> And the priest will give one for a sin-offering and the other for a burned offering to take away the sin which came on him on account of the dead, and he will make his head holy that same day.
<ASV> Do not put anyone to death without cause.
<ASV> Keep your servant back from sins of pride; let them not have rule over me: then will I be upright and free from great sin.
<ASV> For what great nation has a god so near to them as the Lord our God is, whenever we are turned to him in prayer?
<ASV> So this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: See, I will send punishment on the king of Babylon and on his land, as I have given punishment to the king of Assyria.
<ASV> Make a new song to the Lord, and let his praise be sounded from the end of the earth; you who go down to the sea, and everything in it, the sea-lands and their people.
<ASV> Because it is in the Writings, that Abraham had two sons, one by the servant-woman, and one by the free woman.
<ASV> And they had then an important prisoner, whose name was Barabbas.
<ASV> When he sees that the boy is not with us, he will come to his death, and our father's grey head will go down in sorrow to the underworld.
<ASV> Why will you put forward your cause against me? You have all done evil against me, says the Lord.
<ASV> Are you so foolish? having made a start in the Spirit, will you now be made complete in the flesh?
<ASV> How has the daughter of Zion been covered with a cloud by the Lord in his wrath! he has sent down from heaven to earth the glory of Israel, and has not kept in memory the resting-place of his feet in the day of his wrath.
<ASV> And by his side was working Ezer, the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, making good another part opposite the way up to the store of arms at the turning of the wall.
<ASV> Serug, Nahor, Terah,
<ASV> But you will say to me, Why does he still make us responsible? who is able to go against his purpose?
<ASV> Then Esther sent them back to Mordecai with this answer:
<ASV> For from the first making of the world, those things of God which the eye is unable to see, that is, his eternal power and existence, are fully made clear, he having given the knowledge of them through the things which he has made, so that men have no reason for wrongdoing:
<ASV> But truly, there will still be a small band who will be safe, even sons and daughters: and they will come out to you, and you will see their ways and their doings: and you will be comforted about the evil which I have sent on Jerusalem, even about everything I have sent on it.
<ASV> The time has come, the day is near: let not him who gives a price for goods be glad, or him who gets the price have sorrow:
<ASV> This order is fixed by the watchers, and the decision is by the word of the holy ones: so that the living may be certain that the Most High is ruler over the kingdom of men, and gives it to any man at his pleasure, lifting up over it the lowest of men.
<ASV> And they went against his rules, and the agreement which he made with their fathers, and his laws which he gave them; they gave themselves up to things without sense or value, and became foolish like the nations round them, of whom the Lord had said, Do not as they do.
<ASV> But now, when you come together, it is not possible to take the holy meal of the Lord:
<ASV> For this reason, as through one man sin came into the world, and death because of sin, and so death came to all men, because all have done evil:
<ASV> As you have no knowledge of the way of the wind, or of the growth of the bones in the body of her who is with child, even so you have no knowledge of the works of God who has made all.
<ASV> If by chance my father puts his hand on me, it will seem to him that I am tricking him, and he will put a curse on me in place of a blessing.
<ASV> And you took your sons and your daughters whom I had by you, offering even these to them to be their food. Was your loose behaviour so small a thing,
<ASV> The Lord has said about you, O last of Judah, Go not into Egypt: be certain that I have given witness to you this day.
<ASV> The table and its rods and all its vessels, and the holy bread;
<ASV> I did not take my seat among the band of those who are glad, and I had no joy; I kept by myself because of your hand; for you have made me full of wrath.
<ASV> Envy, uncontrolled drinking and feasting, and such things: of which I give you word clearly, even as I did in the past, that they who do such things will have no part in the kingdom of God.
<ASV> Now Abraham was old and far on in years: and the Lord had given him everything in full measure.
<ASV> Then I will give you rain at the right time, and the land will give her increase and the trees of the field will give their fruit;
<ASV> And now, give ear, O Jacob my servant, and Israel whom I have taken for myself:
<ASV> As for me, my agreement is made with you, and you will be the father of nations without end.
<ASV> Because he says in another Psalm, You will not let your Holy One see destruction.
<ASV> After this he made an outer wall for the town of David, on the west side of Gihon in the valley, as far as the way into the town by the fish doorway; and he put a very high wall round the Ophel; and he put captains of the army in all the walled towns of Judah.
<ASV> Day after day it sends out its word, and night after night it gives knowledge.
<ASV> And David said, Solomon my son is young and untested, and the house which is to be put up for the Lord is to be very great, a thing of wonder and glory through all countries; so I will make ready what is needed for it. So David got ready a great store of material before his death.
<ASV> His branches will be stretched out, he will be beautiful as the olive-tree and sweet-smelling as Lebanon.
<ASV> Let your mouth be open, judging rightly, and give right decisions in the cause of the poor and those in need.
<ASV> For I am not able to give names of honour to any man; and if I did, my Maker would quickly take me away.
<ASV> And if you say, Good day, to your brothers only, what do you do more than others? do not even the Gentiles the same?
<ASV> And he was teaching in one of the Synagogues on the Sabbath.
<ASV> And while he was giving the king the story of how Elisha had given life to the dead, the woman whose son had come back to life came to the king with a request for her house and her land. And Gehazi said, My lord king, this is the woman and this is her son, whose life Elisha gave back to him.
<ASV> For the upright will be living in the land, and the good will have it for their heritage.
<ASV> And I will put your flesh on the mountains, and make the valleys full of your blood.
<ASV> Take care to have knowledge about the condition of your flocks, looking well after your herds;
<ASV> For seven days you are to make offerings for the altar and make it holy, so that it may become completely holy, and anything touching it will become holy.
<ASV> His form was shining like the light, and his clothing was white as snow:
<ASV> And the Lord said to Moses, Let every chief on his day give his offering to make the altar holy.
<ASV> Is the seed still in the store-house? have the vine and the fig-tree, the pomegranate and the olive-tree, still not given their fruit? from this day I will send my blessing on you.
<ASV> Let not him who is on the house-top go down to take anything out of his house:
<ASV> He will be judge among the nations, the valleys will be full of dead bodies; the head over a great country will be wounded by him.
<ASV> For it is in the Writings, You who have never given birth, be glad; give cries of joy, you who have had no birth-pains; for the children of her who has been given up by her husband are more than those of the woman who has a husband.
<ASV> For the master of the house is away on a long journey:
<ASV> You who take pride in the law, are you doing wrong to the honour of God by behaviour which is against the law?
<ASV> This is what the Lord of armies has said: Let your judging be upright and done in good faith, let every man have mercy and pity for his brother:
<ASV> And at the right time he sent a servant to the workers to get part of the fruit from the vines; but the workmen gave him blows and sent him away with nothing.
<ASV> My prayer is not for them only, but for all who will have faith in me through their word;
<ASV> Or has taken a false oath about the loss of something which he has come across by chance; if a man has done any of these evil things,
<ASV> Let the upright give me punishment; and let the god-fearing man put me in the right way; but I will not let the oil of sinners come on my head: when they do evil I will give myself to prayer.
<ASV> And the sons of Jehallelel: Ziph and Ziphah, Tiria and Asarel.
<ASV> The fear of the Lord is the best part of wisdom: all those who keep his laws are wise: his praise is eternal.
<ASV> For this reason take up all the arms of God, so that you may be able to be strong in the evil day, and, having done all, to keep your place.
<ASV> All his days are sorrow, and his work is full of grief. Even in the night his heart has no rest. This again is to no purpose.
<ASV> But one of the Sanhedrin, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a man of learning in the law, of whom all the people had a high opinion, got up and made a suggestion for the men to be put outside for a little time.
<ASV> They have become fat and strong: they have gone far in works of evil: they give no support to the cause of the child without a father, so that they may do well; they do not see that the poor man gets his rights.
<ASV> And when the Aramaeans saw that Israel had overcome them, they sent men to get the Aramaeans who were on the other side of the River, with Shophach, the captain of Hadadezer's army, at their head.
<ASV> The sword of the Lord is full of blood, it is fat with the best of the meat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the best parts of the sheep: for the Lord has a feast in Bozrah, and much cattle will be put to death in the land of Edom.
<ASV> And about eight days after he had said these things, he took Peter and John and James with him and went up into the mountain for prayer.
<ASV> And she was full of desire for her lovers, whose flesh is like the flesh of asses and whose seed is like the seed of horses.
<ASV> I put on righteousness as my clothing, and was full of it; right decisions were to me a robe and a head-dress.
<ASV> Then on the thirteenth day of the first month, the king's scribes were sent for, and they put in writing Haman's orders to all the king's captains and the rulers of every division of his kingdom and the chiefs of every people: for every division of the kingdom in the writing commonly used there, and to every people in the language which was theirs; it was signed in the name of King Ahasuerus and stamped with the king's ring.
<ASV> It is the Lord who goes before you; he will be with you, he will not take away his help from you or give you up: so have no fear.
<ASV> And these are the heritages which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar, the priest, and Joshua, the son of Nun, and the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, gave out to them;
<ASV> As clouds and wind without rain, so is one who takes credit for an offering he has not given.
<ASV> But with a storm-wind I sent them in flight among all the nations of whom they had no knowledge. So the land was waste after them, so that no man went through or came back: for they had made waste the desired land.
<ASV> My vine-garden, which is mine, is before me: you, O Solomon, will have the thousand, and those who keep the fruit of them two hundred.
<ASV> They are round me, yes, they are all about me; but in the name of the Lord I will have them cut down.
<ASV> Lord, your house has been dear to me, and the resting-place of your glory.
<ASV> And a certain woman named Lydia, a trader in purple cloth of the town of Thyatira, and a God-fearing woman, gave ear to us: whose heart the Lord made open to give attention to the things which Paul was saying.
<ASV> So the wall was complete on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days.
<ASV> Whose ways are not straight, and whose footsteps are turned to evil:
<ASV> And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come; the earth is full of their violent doings, and now I will put an end to them with the earth.
<ASV> Who were violently taken away before their time, who were overcome by the rush of waters:
<ASV> So make yourself ready, and go and say to them everything I give you orders to say: do not be overcome by fear of them, or I will send fear on you before them.
<ASV> For this is what the Lord has said: The sword of the king of Babylon will come on you.
<ASV> These words of love to you at the end are in my writing, Paul's writing, and this is the mark of every letter from me.
<ASV> And when I saw him, I went down on my face at his feet as one dead. And he put his right hand on me, saying, Have no fear; I am the first and the last and the Living one;
<ASV> And Terah was seventy years old when he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
<ASV> And I will keep myself from talking of anything but those things which Christ has done by me to put the Gentiles under his rule in word and in act,
<ASV> Love has the power of undergoing all things, having faith in all things, hoping all things.
<ASV> And when the priest sees the diseased flesh he will say that he is unclean; the diseased flesh is unclean, he is a leper.
<ASV> But if your eye is evil, all your body will be dark. If then the light which is in you is dark, how dark it will be!
<ASV> Ruling in the mountain of Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, as far as the limits of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half Gilead, to the land of Sihon, king of Heshbon.
<ASV> But if you have been with another in place of your husband and have made yourself unclean with a lover:
<ASV> And of Israel, the sons of Parosh, Ramiah and Izziah and Malchijah and Mijamin and Eleazar and Malchijah and Benaiah.
<ASV> And Moses said to the Lord, O Lord, I am not a man of words; I have never been so, and am not now, even after what you have said to your servant: for talking is hard for me, and I am slow of tongue.
<ASV> Eleazar was the father of Phinehas; Phinehas was the father of Abishua;
<ASV> And these are those who did this work, and their sons. Of the sons of the Kohathites: Heman, who made melody, the son of Joel, the son of Samuel,
<ASV> If death comes suddenly to a man at his side, so that he becomes unclean, let his hair be cut off on the day when he is made clean, on the seventh day.
<ASV> And the young men of his generation said to him, This is the answer to give to the people who came to you saying, Your father put a hard yoke on us, but will you make it less; say to them, My little finger is thicker than my father's body;
<ASV> The deep is boiling like a pot of spices, and the sea like a perfume-vessel.
<ASV> Will the goods of war be taken from the strong man, or the prisoners of the cruel one be let go?
<ASV> Keep them ever folded in your heart, and have them hanging round your neck.
<ASV> I am the Lord your God, who took you out of the land of Egypt so that you might not be servants to them; by me the cords of your yoke were broken and I made you go upright.
<ASV> Peter says to him, Even if I am put to death with you, I will not be false to you. So said all the disciples.
<ASV> For even when we had come into Macedonia our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; there were fightings outside and fears inside.
<ASV> And they will be named, The holy people, Those whose cause has been taken up by the Lord: and you will be named, Desired, A town not given up.
<ASV> For so the way will be open to you into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
<ASV> O people of Moab, go away from the towns and take cover in the rock; be like the dove of the Arabah, which makes her living-place in holes.
<ASV> So they became unclean through their works, going after their evil desires.
<ASV> But if any widow has children or children's children, let these see that it is right to take care of their family and their fathers and mothers: for this is pleasing in the eyes of God.
<ASV> And all those who had control of spirits, and the wonder-workers, and the images, and the false gods, and all the disgusting things which were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, Josiah put away, so that he might give effect to the words of the agreement recorded in the book which Hilkiah the priest made discovery of in the house of the Lord.
<ASV> And his Spirit which he has given us is the witness that we are in him and he is in us.
<ASV> This is the law for all signs of the leper's disease and for skin diseases;
<ASV> And you will have knowledge of what is true, and that will make you free.
<ASV> And there was a voice from the top of the arch which was over their heads: when they came to rest they let down their wings.
<ASV> My son, give attention to my wisdom; let your ear be turned to my teaching:
<ASV> And he gave teaching in the form of a story to the guests who came to the feast, when he saw how they took the best seats; saying to them,
<ASV> And he said to me, Go in and see the evil and disgusting things which they are doing here.
<ASV> And they will give the news to the people of this land: they have had word that you, Lord, are present with this people, letting yourself be seen face to face, and that your cloud is resting over them, and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.
<ASV> Make clear to them that they are to put themselves under rulers and authorities, to do what they are ordered, to be ready for every good work,
<ASV> What is your loved one more than another, O fairest among women? What is your loved one more than another, that you say this to us?
<ASV> This is what the Lord of armies has said: See, I will be the saviour of my people from the east country, and from the west country;
<ASV> He will put up his engines of war against your walls, and your towers will be broken down by his axes.
<ASV> The sons of Simeon: Nemuel and Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, Shaul;
<ASV> So the king went out, taking with him all the people of his house, but for ten of his women, who were to take care of the house.

This was what the men of the army did.
<ASV> For your haters, it seems, are dear to you, and your friends are hated. For you have made it clear that captains and servants are nothing to you: and now I see that if Absalom was living and we had all been dead today, it would have been right in your eyes.
<ASV> The ark of the law, with its rods and its cover;

<ASV> And let the overseers go on to say to the people, If there is any man whose heart is feeble with fear, let him go back to his house before he makes the hearts of his countrymen feeble.
<ASV> And they give the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and full of wonder are your works, O Lord God, Ruler of all; true and full of righteousness are your ways, eternal King.
<ASV> Then came the feast of the opening of the Temple in Jerusalem: it was winter;
<ASV> If my father put a hard yoke on you, I will make it harder: my father gave you punishment with whips, but I will give you blows with snakes.
<ASV> For the things which are done by them in secret it is shame even to put into words.
<ASV> But the man from whom the evil spirits had gone out had a great desire to be with him, but he sent him away, saying,
<ASV> And he went from there into their Synagogue:
<ASV> Then Elisha said, By the life of the Lord of armies whose servant I am, if it was not for the respect I have for Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, I would not give a look at you, or see you.
<ASV> So that you are no longer a servant, but a son; and if a son, then the heritage of God is yours.
<ASV> Come to me, all you who go by! Keep your eyes on me, and see if there is any pain like the pain of my wound, which the Lord has sent on me in the day of his burning wrath.
<ASV> And they have made little of the wounds of the daughter of Zion, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
<ASV> And when, after eight days, the time came for his circumcision, he was named Jesus, the name which the angel had given to him before his birth.
<ASV> So we, when we were young, were kept under the first rules of the world;
<ASV> Make sounds of grief, son of man; with body bent and a bitter heart make sounds of grief before their eyes.
<ASV> Now while he was in Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover, a great number of people came to have faith in his name, after seeing the signs which he did.
<ASV> I myself will give food to my flock, and I will give them rest, says the Lord.
<ASV> And for a hundred talents of silver, he got a hundred thousand fighting-men from Israel.
<ASV> Everything which is high goes in fear of him; he is king over all the sons of pride.
<ASV> And his wealth became very great, increasing more and more;
<ASV> So one of the priests whom they had taken away as a prisoner from Samaria came back, and, living in Beth-el, became their teacher in the worship of the Lord.
<ASV> Abram went on living in the land of Canaan, and Lot went to the lowland towns, moving his tent as far as Sodom.
<ASV> Now the prophets Haggai and Zechariah, the son of Iddo, were preaching to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel.
<ASV> But you kept these things in the secret of your heart; I am certain this was in your thoughts:
<ASV> And for the peace-offerings, two oxen, five male sheep, five he-goats, five he-lambs of the first year: this was the offering of Gamaliel, the son of Pedahzur.
<ASV> He came to him in the waste land, in the unpeopled waste of sand: putting his arms round him and caring for him, he kept him as the light of his eye.
<ASV> Give attention to me, O my people; and give ear to me, O my nation; for teaching will go out from me, and the knowledge of the true God will be a light to the peoples.
<ASV> And the fight was going against Saul, and the archers came across him, and he was wounded by the archers.
<ASV> And after three days they came across him in the Temple, seated among the wise men, giving ear to their words and putting questions to them.
<ASV> He makes rulers come to nothing; the judges of the earth are of no value.
<ASV> I say to you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes of the field, do not let love be moved till it is ready.
<ASV> But do this to them, so that life and not death may be theirs when they come near the most holy things; let Aaron and his sons go in and give to every one his work and that which he is to take up;
<ASV> And Moses said to them, At the end of every seven years, at the time fixed for the ending of debts, at the feast of tents,
<ASV> Let the horn be sounded in Zion, and a war-cry in my holy mountain; let all the people of the land be troubled: for the day of the Lord is coming;
<ASV> And David made answer to Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, By the living Lord, who has kept me safe from all my trouble,
<ASV> Then some of the responsible men of the land got up and said to all the meeting of the people,
<ASV> So he gave her his word with an oath to let her have whatever she might make request for.
<ASV> That same day Moses said to the people,
<ASV> As a bag of myrrh is my well-loved one to me, when he is at rest all night between my breasts.
<ASV> Only by the word of the Lord did this fate come on Judah, to take them away from before his face; because of the sins of Manasseh and all the evil he did;
<ASV> And do not go up by steps to my altar, for fear that your bodies may be seen uncovered.
<ASV> Then again she became with child and gave birth to Abel, his brother. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a farmer.
<ASV> Then all the meeting of the children of Israel, hearing this, came together at Shiloh to go up against them to war.
<ASV> And those in the good earth are those who, having given ear to the word, keep it with a good and true heart, and in quiet strength give fruit.
<ASV> I will not put any evil thing before my eyes; I am against all turning to one side; I will not have it near me.
<ASV> Happy will she be who had faith that the things which the Lord has said to her will be done.
<ASV> In my Father's house are rooms enough; if it was not so, would I have said that I am going to make ready a place for you?
<ASV> And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, made glad with grace and full of the blessing of the Lord: the sea and its fishes will be his.
<ASV> For you see God's design for you, my brothers, that he has not taken a great number of the wise after the flesh, not the strong, not the noble:
<ASV> And the priest is to take one of the male lambs and give it as an offering for wrongdoing, and the log of oil, waving them for a wave offering before the Lord;
<ASV> The locusts have no king, but they all go out in bands;
<ASV> Because he has been cruel to the poor, turning away from them in their trouble; because he has taken a house by force which he did not put up;
<ASV> Will not all these take up a word of shame against him and a bitter saying against him, and say, A curse on him who goes on taking what is not his and is weighted down with the property of debtors!
<ASV> And say, Be our saviour, O God of our salvation, and let us come back, and give us salvation from the nations, so that we may give honour to your holy name and have glory in your praise.
<ASV> Then at their request for a king, God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the family of Benjamin, who was their king for forty years.
<ASV> And there was seen another sign in heaven; a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven crowns.
<ASV> But on the day after, they sent the horsemen on with him, and went back to their place:
<ASV> The town is waste and broken down: every house is shut up, so that no man may come in.
<ASV> And the children of Israel went on with all the sins which Jeroboam did; they did not keep themselves from them;
<ASV> So keep these laws and do them; for so will your wisdom and good sense be clear in the eyes of the peoples, who hearing all these laws will say, Truly, this great nation is a wise and far-seeing people.
<ASV> And to the angel of the church in Smyrna say: These things says the first and the last, who was dead and is living:
<ASV> Truly I say to you, A servant is not greater than his lord; and he who is sent is not greater than the one who sent him.
<ASV> And the Lord give you increase of love in fullest measure to one another and to all men, even as our love to you;
<ASV> I will ever keep your orders in mind; for in them I have life.
<ASV> Then the House was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who were responsible for moving the House, went forward.
<ASV> For the family of Ahab will come to an end; every male of Ahab's family will be cut off, he who is shut up and he who goes free in Israel.
<ASV> But you have some names in Sardis who have kept clean their robes; and as a reward they will go in white with me.
<ASV> Who sends sudden destruction on the strong, so that destruction comes on the walled town.
<ASV> Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.
<ASV> The great water-vessel with the twelve oxen under it.
<ASV> As for me, this secret is not made clear to me because of any wisdom which I have more than any living man, but in order that the sense of the dream may be made clear to the king, and that you may have knowledge of the thoughts of your heart.
<ASV> But Jeroboam had put some of his men to make a surprise attack on them from the back, so some were facing Judah and others were stationed secretly at their back.
<ASV> Shallum, Amariah, Joseph.
<ASV> The number of his army was fifty-nine thousand, three hundred.
<ASV> That it may be used by Aaron and his sons for washing their hands and feet;
<ASV> And when the sons of the prophets who were facing him at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha. And they came out to him, and went down on the earth before him.
<ASV> Wherever the dead body is, there will the eagles come together.
<ASV> And when your son says to you in time to come, What is the reason for these rules and laws and decisions which the Lord our God has given you?
<ASV> And now I have given all these lands into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant; and I have given the beasts of the field to him for his use.
<ASV> This was my condition, wasted by heat in the day and by the bitter cold at night; and sleep went from my eyes.
<ASV> And the Lord said to Moses,
<ASV> And he said, Go on your way, Daniel: for the words are secret and shut up till the time of the end;
<ASV> For it is one rule after another; one line after another; here a little, there a little.
<ASV> And they will be certain that I the Lord their God am with them, and that they, the children of Israel, are my people, says the Lord.
<ASV> And I will take you out from the peoples and get you together out of the countries where you are wandering, with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with burning wrath let loose:
<ASV> When those of his house who are still living come to their end by disease, they are not put into the earth, and their widows are not weeping for them.
<ASV> The sons of Kohath: Amminadab his son, Korah his son, Assir his son,
<ASV> For you had faith in your evil-doing; you said, No one sees me; by your wisdom and knowledge you have been turned out of the way: and you have said in your heart, I am, and there is no other.
<ASV> Shammoth the Harodite, Helez the Pelonite,
<ASV> Then Joab sent David news of everything which had taken place in the war:
<ASV> And the walls round Jerusalem were broken down by the Chaldaean army which was with the captain.
<ASV> The reward of your evil designs and your disgusting ways has come on you, says the Lord.
<ASV> There are three things whose steps are good to see, even four whose goings are fair:
<ASV> For when you take your food, everyone takes his meal before the other; and one has not enough food, and another is the worse for drink.
<ASV> And he had the houses pulled down of those who were used for sex purposes in the house of the Lord, where women were making robes for the Asherah.
<ASV> I say what is true in Christ, and not what is false, my mind giving witness with me in the Holy Spirit,
<ASV> Do not put anyone to death without cause.
<ASV> Then it will come about that the sword, which is the cause of your fear, will overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and need of food, which you are fearing, will go after you there in Egypt; and there death will come to you.
<ASV> If then you are making an offering at the altar and there it comes to your mind that your brother has something against you,
<ASV> And he put them all on the hands of Aaron and on the hands of his sons, waving them for a wave offering before the Lord.
<ASV> To whom have your words been said? and whose spirit came out from you?
<ASV> He keeps back your life from destruction, crowning you with mercy and grace.
<ASV> Because I saw that your heart was hard, and that your neck was an iron cord, and your brow brass;
<ASV> And the limit will go on to Ziphron, with its farthest point at Hazar-enan: this will be your limit on the north.
<ASV> And now, Lord, what am I waiting for? my hope is in you.
<ASV> And moving from there, he went into the house of a man named Titus Justus, a God-fearing man, whose house was very near the Synagogue.
<ASV> What then is my reward? This, that when I am giving the good news, I may give it without payment, not making use of my rights as a preacher of the good news.
<ASV> There are three things, the wonder of which overcomes me, even four things outside my knowledge:
<ASV> Do not keep back training from the child: for even if you give him blows with the rod, it will not be death to him.
<ASV> So David went there, taking with him his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail, the wife of Nabal of Carmel.
<ASV> May grace, mercy, and peace be with us from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in all true love.
<ASV> And he took me to the north doorway: and he took the measure of it by these measures;
<ASV> And Jonah first of all went a day's journey into the town, and crying out said, In forty days destruction will overtake Nineveh.
<ASV> And he gave orders to the captain to keep Paul under his control, and to let him have everything he had need of; and not to keep his friends from coming to see him.
<ASV> And though they are taken away as prisoners by their attackers, even there will I give orders to the sword to put them to death: my eyes will be fixed on them for evil and not for good.
<ASV> This is what the Lord has said: Because they say to you, You, O land, are the destruction of men, causing loss of children to your nation;
<ASV> And the Lord said to me, Make no attack on Moab and do not go to war with them, for I will not give you any of his land: because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for their heritage.
<ASV> So will I make songs in praise of your name for ever, giving to God that which is right day by day.
<ASV> For this cause the Lord has said: See, I am against Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and by me his strong arm will be broken; and I will make the sword go out of his hand.
<ASV> And you are to make a cover of the best gold, two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.
<ASV> Did the gods of the nations keep safe those on whom my fathers sent destruction, Gozan and Haran and Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?
<ASV> And I will take up my cause against him with disease and with blood; and I will send down on him and on his forces and on the peoples who are with him, an overflowing shower and great ice-drops, fire, and burning.
<ASV> This is how it is to be done: every creditor is to give up his right to whatever he has let his neighbour have; he is not to make his neighbour, his countryman, give it back; because a general forgiveness has been ordered by the Lord.
<ASV> No one has knowledge of a man's grief but himself; and a strange person has no part in his joy.
<ASV> And he has put all things under his feet, and has made him to be head over all things to the church,
<ASV> And I will make that land undergo everything I have said against it, even everything recorded in this book, which Jeremiah the prophet has said against all the nations.
<ASV> As long as we have life we are living to the Lord; or if we give up our life it is to the Lord; so if we are living, or if our life comes to an end, we are the Lord's.
<ASV> &lt;To the chief music-maker. A Song. A Psalm.&gt; Send up a glad cry to God, all the earth:
<ASV> And it will be in that day that in every place where before there were a thousand vines valued at a thousand shekels of silver, there will be nothing but blackberries and thorns.
<ASV> I am waiting for the Lord, my soul is waiting for him, and my hope is in his word.
<ASV> The orders which Jonadab, the son of Rechab, gave to his sons to take no wine, are done, and to this day they take no wine, for they do the orders of their father: but I have sent my words to you, getting up early and sending them, and you have not given ear to me.
<ASV> And they took from Moses all the offerings which the children of Israel had given for the building of the holy place. And still they went on giving him more free offerings every morning.
<ASV> And on the limit of Reuben, from the east side to the west side: Judah, one part.
<ASV> So you were kept waiting in Kadesh for a long time.
<ASV> As for you, O King, the Most High God gave to Nebuchadnezzar, your father, the kingdom and great power and glory and honour:
<ASV> Go up to Lebanon and give a cry; let your voice be loud in Bashan, crying out from Abarim; for all your lovers have come to destruction
<ASV> And of the children of Benjamin, the brothers of Saul, three thousand; for up to that time the greater part of them had been true to Saul.
<ASV> Ice was rained down on their cattle; thunderstorms sent destruction among the flocks.
<ASV> Though he might have pride in his soul in his life-time, and men will give you praise if you do well for yourself,
<ASV> The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, whose father was a man of Tyre, an expert worker in gold and silver and brass and iron, in stone and wood, in purple and blue and fair linen and red, trained in the cutting of every sort of ornament and the invention of every sort of design; let him be given a place among your expert workmen and those of my lord, your father David.
<ASV> It is simpler for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a man who has much money to come into the kingdom of God.
<ASV> But by your hard and unchanged heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of the revelation of God's judging in righteousness;
<ASV> He sent from on high, he took me, pulling me out of great waters.
<ASV> For if the operation of the law, giving death, recorded in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the eyes of the children of Israel had to be turned away from the face of Moses because of its glory, a glory which was only for a time:
<ASV> And God said all these words:
<ASV> And he said, Are you truly my son Esau? And he said, I am.
<ASV> Then at that time, on the twenty-third day of the third month, which is the month Sivan, the king's scribes were sent for; and everything ordered by Mordecai was put in writing and sent to the Jews and the captains and the rulers and the chiefs of all the divisions of the kingdom from India to Ethiopia, a hundred and twenty-seven divisions, to every division in the writing commonly used there, and to every people in their language, and to the Jews in their writing and their language.
<ASV> Making signs with his eyes, rubbing with his feet, and giving news with his fingers;
<ASV> But I have knowledge of you that you have no love for God in your hearts.
<ASV> Then Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the king, but he would not come to him: and he sent again a second time, but he would not come.
<ASV> Is this your answer to the Lord, O foolish people and unwise? Is he not your father who has given you life? He has made you and given you your place.
<ASV> And take no thought for your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.
<ASV> False witnesses got up: they put questions to me about crimes of which I had no knowledge.
<ASV> And said to him, Your servants have taken note of the number of all the fighting-men under our orders, and every one is present;
<ASV> In the same way, the chief priests, making sport of him, with the scribes and those in authority, said,
<ASV> And they were all surprised and in doubt saying to one another, What is the reason of this?
<ASV> The heads of the great snake were crushed by you; you gave them as food to the fishes of the sea.
<ASV> The crown of pride of those who are given up to wine in Ephraim will be crushed under foot;
<ASV> The highways are waste, no man is journeying there: the agreement is broken, he has made sport of the towns, he has no thought for man.
<ASV> Truly, the hills, and the noise of an army on the mountains, are a false hope: truly, in the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel.
<ASV> And said to the judges, Take care what you do, for you are judging not for man but for the Lord, and he is with you in the decisions you give.
<ASV> And Peter, protesting, said to him, Be it far from you, Lord; it is impossible that this will come about.
<ASV> See, he is stretching out his mist, covering the tops of the mountains with it.
<ASV> About Judah. What have you to do in my house? is it your thought that oaths and holy flesh will get you out of your trouble? will you make yourself safe in this way?
<ASV> Your father put a hard yoke on us: if you will make the conditions under which your father kept us down less cruel, and the weight of the yoke he put on us less hard, then we will be your servants.
<ASV> After that, he had connection with his wife, and she became with child and gave birth to a son, to whom his father gave the name of Beriah, because trouble had come on his family.
<ASV> But you, O Lord, are eternal; and your name will never come to an end.
<ASV> In this way it became taller than all the trees of the field; and its branches were increased and its arms became long because of the great waters.
<ASV> Then everyone who went in fear of the words of the God of Israel, because of the sin of those who had come back, came together to me; and I kept where I was, overcome with grief, till the evening offering.
<ASV> Take care of them and keep them, till you put them on the scales before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites and the chiefs of the families of Israel, in Jerusalem, in the rooms of the house of the Lord.
<ASV> May the Lord be good and true to you: and I myself will see that your kind act is rewarded, because you have done this thing.
<ASV> Whose birth was from God and not from blood, or from an impulse of the flesh and man's desire.
<ASV> In the same way, with the cup, after the meal, he said, This cup is the new testament in my blood: do this, whenever you take it, in memory of me.
<ASV> For this cause says the Lord God, See, I am placing in Zion as a base, a stone, a tested stone, an angle-stone which is certain and of great value: and he who has faith will not give way.
<ASV> My eyes are wasted with weeping, the inmost parts of my body are deeply moved, my inner parts are drained out on the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because of the young children and babies at the breast who are falling without strength in the open squares of the town.
<ASV> In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you are to have the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread is to be your food.
<ASV> The hater of authority, searching for wisdom, does not get it; but knowledge comes readily to the open-minded man.
<ASV> But when the workmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is he who will one day be the owner of the property; come, let us put him to death and take his heritage.
<ASV> Praise be to God for what he has given, which words have no power to say.
<ASV> They will not be shamed in the evil time, and in the days when all are in need of food they will have enough.
<ASV> But the Rab-shakeh said to them, Is it to your master or to you that my master has sent me to say these words? has he not sent me to the men seated on the wall? for they are the people who will be short of food with you when the town is shut in.
<ASV> Because of your sin against me before the children of Israel at the waters of Meribath Kadesh in the waste land of Zin; because you did not keep my name holy among the children of Israel.
<ASV> His back is made of lines of plates, joined tight together, one against the other, like a stamp.
<ASV> And he put the banded sticks in the drinking-places where the flock came to get water; and they became with young when they came to the water.
<ASV> They will never be in need of food or drink: and they will never again be troubled by the burning heat of the sun:
<ASV> This is a great secret: but my words are about Christ and the church.
<ASV> And put oil on the washing-vessel and its base, and make them holy.
<ASV> See, I will get them together from all the countries where I have sent them in my wrath and in the heat of my passion and in my bitter feeling; and I will let them come back into this place where they may take their rest safely.
<ASV> The children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel,
